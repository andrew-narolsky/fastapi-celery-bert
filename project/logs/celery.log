Overview [ edit ] A new competition, The Football League , started this season . The Football League was open to clubs all over the United Kingdom , [ citation needed ] but the first twelve entrants ( Accrington , Aston Villa , Blackburn Rovers , Bolton Wanderers , Burnley , Derby County , Everton , Notts County , Preston North End , Stoke (now Stoke City ), West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers ) were all from the Midlands or North of England (in later years the competition became the de facto English league, though some clubs from outside England still compete in it). Each club in the League played each other twice (once at home and once away) and would be awarded two points for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. From these points, a league table was drawn up. Preston North End were in first place at the end of the season and thus became the first ever Football League champions. They did not lose a match all season (a feat only accomplished once since, by Arsenal in 2003–04 ) and also won the FA Cup . The Football League is still going today and now has 72 clubs in three divisions (down from an all-time high of 92 clubs in four divisions). Since the 1992–93 season , it has become only the second-most important league competition, behind the FA Premier League in the English football league system .

For women's champions, see List of English women's football champions .      English League (1st tier)   Football League (1888–1892) Football League First Division (1892–1992) Premier League (1992–present)   Country     England   Founded    1888   Number of teams    20 (since 1995–96 season)   Current champions    Manchester City ( 2022–23 )   Most successful club    Manchester United (20 championships)  Leicester City celebrate winning the Premier League in the 2015–16 season.  The English football champions are the winners of the highest league in English men's football, which since 1992–93 is the Premier League .  Since the creation of the Premier League, the winners of The Football League were no longer English champions as the Premier League is a separate league. Following the codification of professional football by the Football Association in 1885, [1] the Football League was established in 1888, after meetings initiated by Aston Villa director William McGregor . [2] At the end of the 1888–89 season, Preston North End were the first club to be crowned champions after completing their fixtures unbeaten. [3]  The league's early years were dominated by teams from the North and Midlands, where professionalism had been embraced more readily than in the South of England. [4] Its status as the country's pre-eminent league was strengthened in 1892, when the rival Football Alliance was absorbed into the Football League. [5] Former Alliance clubs comprised the bulk of a new Second Division , from which promotion to the top level could be gained. It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman 's Arsenal secured the title. [6]  Rules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs. [7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England , [8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs. [9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt. [10]  All the clubs which have ever been champions are still in existence today and all take part in the top four tiers of the English football league system . Sheffield Wednesday are the only club who have ever changed their name after winning a league title having been known as The Wednesday for the first three of their four titles. Manchester United have won twenty titles, [11] the most of any club. [12]  United's rivals  Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993
and 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before World War I . Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017). Huddersfield Town , Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.

The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72). Five teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023). Seven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971). Eight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference. Teams in bold compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season .

The current holders are Burnley , who won the 2022–23 edition . Introduced for the 2004–05 season as the Football League Championship , the division is a rebrand of the former Football League First Division , which itself is a rebrand of the now-defunct Football League Second Division prior to the 1992 launch of the Premier League . The winning club of this division  each season receives the EFL Championship trophy, which was the previous trophy awarded to the winners of the English top-flight prior to the launch of the Premier League. As with other divisions of professional English football, Welsh clubs can be part of this division, thus making it a cross-border league. Each season, the two top-finishing teams in the Championship are automatically promoted to the Premier League . The teams that finish the season in 3rd to 6th place enter a playoff tournament, with the winner also gaining promotion to the Premier League . The three lowest-finishing teams in the Championship are relegated to League One . The Championship is the wealthiest non-top-flight football division in the world, the ninth-richest division in Europe , [2] and the tenth best-attended division in world football (with the highest per-match attendance of any secondary league). [3] Its average match attendance for the 2018–19 season was 20,181. [4]  Cardiff City have spent more seasons in this division than any other team, and Birmingham City currently hold the longest tenure in this division having last been absent in the 2010–11 season . Barnsley became the first club to attain 1,000 wins in second-tier English league football with a 2–1 home victory over Coventry City on 3 January 2011. They also became the first club to play 3,000 games in second-level English league football following another 2–1 home victory, this time against Brighton & Hove Albion on 12 March 2013. (W1028, D747, L1224). [5]   History [ edit ] For its history between 1892 and 1992, see Football League Second Division . For its history between 1992 and 2004, see Football League First Division .

( January 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Sunderland won the league in the first season since rebranding, with Wigan Athletic finishing second to win promotion to the top flight of English football for the first time in their history. They had only been elected to the Football League in 1987; playing in the fourth tier as recently as 1994 before their promotion. West Ham United won the first Championship play-off final that season, following a 1–0 victory over Preston North End at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The 2004–05 season saw the division announce a total attendance (including postseason) of 9.8 million, the fourth-highest total attendance for a European football division, behind the Premier League (12.88 million), Spain's La Liga (11.57 million) and Germany's Bundesliga (10.92 million). [6] [7] [8] Additionally, Millwall , competing in the inaugural Championship season, qualified for the UEFA Cup , only to lose in the first qualifying round. In the 2005–06 season , Reading broke the Football League points record for a season, finishing with 106 points, exceeding the record of 105 set by Sunderland in 1999. [9]  Sunderland won their second Championship title in the 2006–07 season , after being relegated from the top division the previous season. On 4 May 2007, Leeds United became the first side since the re-branding of the division to enter administration; they were deducted 10 points and were relegated as a result. [10] [11] On 28 May 2007, Derby County won the first Championship play-off final at the new Wembley Stadium , beating West Bromwich Albion 1–0. [12] West Brom would go on to win the Championship in the following season. Burnley , who finished fifth in 2009, defeated Sheffield United to earn their first season in the newly branded Premier League, last being in the Football League First Division in 1976. [13]  On 30 September 2009, Coca-Cola announced they would end their sponsorship deal with the Football League, which began in 2004, at the end of the 2009–10 season . [14] On 16 March 2010, npower were announced as the new title sponsors of the Football League, and from the start of the 2010–11 Football League season until the end of the 2012–13 season, the Football League Championship was known as the Npower Championship . [15]  Crystal Palace became the second Championship club to enter administration in 2010. [16]  After winning the 2011 League Cup Final , Birmingham City became the first Championship club to compete in the group stage of the UEFA Cup/Europa League , finishing third in the group, only one point behind Portuguese club Braga . Birmingham City eventually finished fourth in the Championship that season, and would lose to fifth-place Blackpool in the play-off. Wigan Athletic became the second club to participate in the Europa League group stage after winning the 2013 FA Cup, only to accumulate one win and lose their last three group matches. [17]  On 18 July 2013, UK bookmaker Sky Bet announced that they had signed a five-year agreement to sponsor the league. [18]  On 24 May 2014, the Championship play-off final between Derby County and Queens Park Rangers saw the highest crowd for any Championship fixture – 87,348 witnessed a Bobby Zamora stoppage time winner for QPR to win promotion for the London club. [19]  For the 2016–17 season , the Football League was rebranded as the English Football League. The league had a cumulative attendance of more than 11 million – excluding play-off matches – with more than two million watching Newcastle United and Aston Villa home fixtures alone, both of whom had been relegated from the Premier League in the previous season. This was included in the highest crowds for the second to fourth tier in England since the 1958–59 season . [20] Newcastle won the title in 2016–17, while Aston Villa finished 13th, eventually returning to the Premier League in 2019. [21]  On 13 March 2020, Championship play was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic , with a suspension lasting until 4 April. It was then extended to the end of April, with the league eventually restarting on 20 June. Leeds United were confirmed as champions on 17 July 2020, being promoted to the Premier League for the first time in 16 years. [22]  Brentford , having been in League Two in 2009 and gaining promotion to the Championship five years later, were promoted following a play-off victory against Swansea City on 29 May 2021, after losing the play-off to Fulham the previous year. [23] On 29 May 2022, Nottingham Forest , having been in the Championship for 14 consecutive seasons, ended their 23-year absence from the top flight by beating Huddersfield Town in the play-off final, after being last in the league as late as round 8 of the 2021–22 season. [24]  The EFL Championship took a unique four-week break in November and December 2022 to allow for players to join their national teams at the 2022 FIFA World Cup held in Qatar . [25]  League structure [ edit ] The league comprises 24 teams. Over the course of a season, which runs annually from August to the following May (in 2022, the year of a World Cup break in November and December, the league started in July), each team plays twice against the others in the league, once at 'home' and once 'away', resulting in each team competing in 46 games in total. Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw, and zero for a loss. The teams are ranked in the league table by points gained, then goal difference, then goals scored, and then their head-to-head record for that season (including away goals record). If two or more teams finish the season equal in all these respects, then teams are separated by alphabetical order, unless a promotion, relegation, or play-off place (see below) is at stake, when the teams are separated by a play-off game, though this improbable situation has never arisen in all the years the rule has existed. [26]  At the end of the season, the top two teams and the winner of the Championship play-offs are promoted to the Premier League and the bottom three teams are relegated to EFL League One . The Football League Championship play-offs is a knock-out competition for the teams finishing the season in third to sixth place with the winner being promoted to the Premier League. In the play-offs, the third-placed team plays against the sixth-placed team and the fourth-placed team plays against the fifth-placed team in two-legged semi-finals (home and away). The winners of each semi-final then compete in a single match at Wembley Stadium with the prize being promotion to the Premier League and the Championship play-off trophy.

Bundesliga (22,224), with an average of 18,787 spectators per game in the 2022–23 season. The Championship is the fifth most watched league in Europe. [29]  The highest average league attendance was in 2017–18 season, when 11.3 million fans attended Championship matches, at an average of 20,489 per game.

Funeral services, a procession, and a lying in state were first held in Washington, D.C. , then a funeral train transported Lincoln's remains 1,654 miles (2,662 km) through seven states for burial in Springfield, Illinois .  Never exceeding 20 mph, the train made several stops in principal cities and state capitals for processions, orations, and additional lyings in state. Millions of Americans viewed the train along the route and participated in associated ceremonies. The train left Washington, on April 21 at 12:30  pm. It bore Lincoln's eldest son Robert Todd and the remains of Lincoln's younger son, William Wallace Lincoln (1850–1862), [a] but not Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln , who was too distraught to make the trip. [2] The train largely retraced the route Lincoln had traveled to Washington as the president-elect on his way to his first inauguration , more than four years earlier. The train arrived at Springfield on May 3. Lincoln was interred on May 4, at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. Every town the train passed or stopped in there was always a crowd to pay their respects. By 1874, several features had been added to the Lincoln Tomb , including a 117-foot (36 m)-tall granite  obelisk surrounded with several bronze statues of Lincoln and soldiers and sailors. Mary Todd Lincoln and three of their four sons—Willie, Eddie , and Tad —are also buried there. [b] Today, it is owned and managed as a state historic site .  Washington, D.C. [ edit ] After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth , Lincoln's body was carried by an honor guard to the White House on Saturday April 15, 1865. He lay in state in the East Room of the White House which was open to the public on Tuesday, April 18. On April 19, a funeral service was held and then the coffin, attended by large crowds, was transported in a procession down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol Rotunda , where a ceremonial burial service was held. The body again lay in state on the 20th and on the early morning of the following day a prayer service was held for the Lincoln cabinet officials. [4]  Funeral train to Springfield, Illinois [ edit ] Lincoln's funeral train At 7  a.m. on Friday, April 21, the Lincoln coffin was taken by honor guard to the depot. Cabinet secretaries Edwin M. Stanton , Gideon Welles , Hugh McCulloch , and John Palmer Usher , as well as, generals Ulysses S. Grant , and Montgomery C. Meigs left the escort at the depot, and at 8  a.m. the train departed. At least 10,000 people witnessed the train's departure from Washington. Lincoln's house draped in mourning with his horse "Old Robin" in front, Springfield, Illinois, 1865 The funeral train had nine cars, including a baggage car, hearse car, and the President's car, built for use by the president and other officials and containing a parlor, sitting room, and sleeping apartment. The President's car was draped in mourning and carried the coffins of Lincoln and his son. New locomotives were substituted at several points. The Department of War designated the route and declared the railroads used as military roads. Only persons authorized by the State Department were allowed to travel on the train, which was limited to 20 miles (32 km) an hour for safety. A pilot train preceded it to ensure the track was clear. Five relatives and family friends were appointed to accompany the funeral train: David Davis , Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States ; Lincoln's brothers-in-law, Ninian Wirt Edwards and C. M. Smith; Brigadier General John Blair Smith Todd , a cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln; and Charles Alexander Smith, the brother of C. M. Smith. An honor guard accompanied the train; this consisted of Union Army  Major General  David Hunter ; brevet Major General John G. Barnard ; Brigadier Generals Edward D. Townsend , Charles Thomas Campbell , Amos Beebe Eaton , John C. Caldwell , Alfred Terry , George D. Ramsey, and Daniel McCallum; Union Navy  Rear Admiral  Charles Henry Davis and Captain  William Rogers Taylor ; and Marine Corps  Major Thomas H. Field. Four accompanied the train in a logistics capacity: Captain Charles Penrose, as quartermaster and commissary of subsistence; Ward Hill Lamon , Lincoln's longtime bodyguard and friend and U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia; and Dr. Charles B. Brown and Frank T. Sands, embalmer and undertaker , respectively. [5]  Governor  Oliver P. Morton of Indiana ; Governor  John Brough of Ohio ; and Governor  William M. Stone of Iowa accompanied the train with their aides. [5]  Lincoln's funeral train was the first national commemoration of a president's death by rail. Lincoln was observed, mourned, and honored by the citizens and visitors of Washington, Maryland , Pennsylvania , New York , Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois in the following cities:   City  Arrive  Lying in state in   Public viewing from / until   Depart  Image   Washington, D.C.

After the autopsy Lincoln's body was brought (Monday evening, April 17) to the great East Room; the room was draped with crape and black cloth, relieved only here and there by white flowers and green leaves. The catafalque upon which the casket lay was about fifteen feet high, and consisted of an elevated platform resting on a dais and covered with a domed canopy of black cloth which was supported by four pillars, and was lined beneath with fluted white silk... From the time the body had been made ready for burial until the last services in the house, it was watched night and day by a guard of honor, the members of which were one major-general, one brigadier-general, two field officers, and four line officers of the army and four of the navy. The room was darkened — a sort of chapelle ardente. April 19: a short service was held in the Green Room Military units marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. during the state funeral for Abraham Lincoln on April 19, 1865 Remark #2: April 19–21, 1865: lying in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. Arrival: April 19, 1865, 3  p.m. The procession started from the White House at 2  p.m. and proceeded up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol amidst the tolling of bells and the firing of minute-guns. The funeral car was large. The lower base was fourteen feet [4.2 m] long and seven feet [2.1 m] wide, and eight feet [2.4 m] from the ground. The upper base, upon which the coffin rested, was eleven feet [3.4 m] long and five feet [1.5 m] below the top of the canopy. The canopy was surmounted by a gilt eagle, covered with crape. The hearse was entirely covered with cloth, velvet, crape and alpaca. The seat was covered with cloth, and on each side was a splendid lamp. The car was fifteen feet [4.6 m] high, and the coffin was so placed as to afford a full view to all spectators. It was drawn by six gray horses, each attended by a groom. The avenue was cleared the whole length... The sound of muffled drums was heard, and the procession, with a slow and measured tread, moved from the home of mourning on its mission with the remains of the illustrious dead. Despite the enormous crowd the silence was profound. The funeral car was carried up the steps of the Capitol, beneath the spot where, six weeks before, the president had delivered his second Inaugural, and into the rotunda, where the body was removed from the car to another catafalque, where a service was read. Here the procession dispersed, leaving the remains of the president in the rotunda, where they were open to view the next day—The public viewing started April 20, 1865 (early morning)-- Depart from U.S. Capitol: April 21, 1865, 7  a.m.; coffin moved to Washington's Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Depot  Remark #3: Michigan City, Ind. was a 35 min. stop; Lincoln's funeral train was forced to wait here for a committee of more than one hundred important men from Chicago, who were coming out to escort the train into their city; citizens of Michigan City held an impromptu funeral (patriotic organizations conducted memorial services and 16 young women were permitted to enter the funeral car; flowers were placed on the coffin) –  Commemoration [ edit ] There is an immersive laying in state exhibit in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, IL.  The exhibit is a full scale recreation of the Representative's Hall in the Old State Capital Building in Springfield.  It is based on period photographs and etchings, as well as reporter's descriptions.  The hall depicts the moment Lincoln was laid in state there, with lavish, elaborate, and sometimes odd decorations, including a replica black casket. [8]  Burial site selection [ edit ] The Mather Vault Shortly after Lincoln's death, a delegation of Illinois citizens (later forming the National Lincoln Monument Association ) asked Mrs. Lincoln to return her husband's remains to Springfield for burial. She agreed, and the group then researched various sites in and around Springfield, selecting a centrally located, hilltop site known as Mather Block, and a temporary receiving vault was built there. However, Mrs. Lincoln selected Oak Ridge Cemetery for her husband's burial. Despite repeated attempts by the association to change the location of the burial to Mather Block, she remained firm in her decision. [9]  Springfield's choice: The Mather Vault [ edit ] A large number of Illinois politicians were in Washington when Lincoln was assassinated, including the Governor , Richard J. Oglesby , a close friend of Lincoln. A few hours after Lincoln's death they met in Sen. Richard Yates' room at the National Hotel , to arrange a burial in Springfield, Illinois. Governor Oglesby was selected to confer with the Lincoln family on a burial place. Informal conferences were held on April 16. Mary Lincoln was not receiving visitors, but she preferred Chicago or the empty crypt in the U.S. Capitol that had been prepared for George Washington. She finally relented when her son Robert Todd Lincoln was able to persuade her to allow a Springfield burial, by promising to take Willie Lincoln's body along. Springfield wanted a prominent burial location, a location that would draw visitors into downtown Springfield. A 6-acre (24,000 m 2 ) block, owned by the family of Col. Thomas Mather, was selected, a plot that could be seen from the major railroad line (Chicago and Alton Railroad), a plot in the center of Springfield on a hill. Fifty thousand dollars were donated for the purchase and the work of constructing a temporary vault started immediately. The vault was designed to be a resting place for the remains until a grand monument could be erected. By men working night and day, through sunshine and rain, it was ready for use on May 24 (the day of the burial), although the work was not quite completed on the outside. The Mather Block of land was later used as the site of the Illinois State Capitol building. [10]  Mary Lincoln's choice: Oak Ridge Cemetery [ edit ] Oak Ridge receiving vault Mary Lincoln however recalled that Lincoln once had said that he wanted a quiet place for his burial at Oak Ridge (said to her on May 24, 1860, when Lincoln, then running for president, and Mary attended the dedication of Oak Ridge, a rural quiet cemetery, two miles (3.2 km) from the heart of Springfield). On April 28 Mary sent a message to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton , in which she stated that her decision was final and that Lincoln's remains must be placed in the Oak Ridge Cemetery. On April 29 another message followed: "arrangements for using the Mather vault must be changed." And on May 1 the message was: "the remains of the president should be placed in the vault of Oak Ridge and nowhere else." The Oak Ridge vault was readied, but work on the Mather vault continued as a "contingency." [11]  Even after the burial, the debate was not over. The National Lincoln Monument Association began again to stoke the fires of creating the grand tomb for Lincoln at the Mather Block. Mary Lincoln threatened to have her husband's remains taken to Chicago or Washington for permanent burial. "My determination is unalterable," she wrote on June 10 and demanded a formal promise that "the immortal Savior and Martyr for Freedom" would be at Oak Ridge, and imposed a deadline of June 15 before she would make good on her threat. The association voted, on the evening before the deadline, by the narrowest of margins, 8–7, to accept her demands. Oak Ridge Cemetery became the site of the Lincoln Tomb. Attempted theft and movement of remains [ edit ] Attempted theft [ edit ] When the tomb was completed in 1874, Lincoln's coffin was placed in a white marble sarcophagus in a burial room behind a steel gate locked with a padlock. In November 1876, Chicago counterfeiter James "Big Jim" Kennally planned to steal Lincoln's body and hold it in exchange for a pardon for his engraver (who was serving a ten-year sentence at Illinois State Penitentiary ) and $200,000 (approximately $5,496,000 today). [12] [13] The plot failed when two men recruited to assist turned out to be paid government informants, [12] [13] and the men sent to get the body did not plan for how to remove the quarter-ton cedar-and-lead coffin from the grounds. [13]  On November 13, 1876, tomb custodian John Carroll Power and a group of trusted confidants moved the coffin from its room to a secret location in the basement of the tomb. [13] Finding the ground waterlogged, they temporarily set the coffin on the ground and disguised it under a wood pile. Moving the coffin proved difficult; it weighed some 400–500 pounds (180–230 kilograms) and Power and the members of the Monument Association were mostly in their 60s (the youngest was 56). They were relieved to find that the seals on the coffin were intact and that Lincoln's remains had not been disturbed. The following July, Kennally or some other member of the conspiracy asked Power to bury the coffin. He said that the unventilated basement was almost impossible to enter in the summer weather and also moving the heavy coffin had been brutally hard on himself and the other aging Monument Association members. Power, who had recently celebrated his 70th birthday, said that he suffered from crippling pain for months afterward and had no desire to do it again. The coffin therefore sat in the basement for another year. Finally, a group of men in their 30s were hired to move the coffin and on November 18, 1878, the coffin was moved and reburied in a shallow grave on the far end of the labyrinth. After receiving anonymous threats in the mail, the coffin was dug up two days later to make sure it was still there. [12]  In 1880, Power and his associates formed the "Lincoln Guard of Honor" to serve as the custodians of Lincoln's remains. Other than its members, only Robert Todd Lincoln knew of this organization. In 1882, after Mary Todd Lincoln died, Robert instructed the Guard of Honor to bury his mother's coffin wherever they kept his father's. Both coffins remained in the basement until 1887, when they were encased in a brick vault, at which time Lincoln's coffin was opened to verify his remains were still there. [12]  Tomb reconstruction and exhumation [ edit ] The original tomb, built on unsuitable soil, was in constant need of repair. In 1900, a complete reconstruction was undertaken, Lincoln's remains were exhumed, and the coffin was placed back in the white marble sarcophagus. [12] On April 25, 1901, upon completion of the reconstruction, Robert Todd Lincoln visited the tomb. He was unhappy with the disposition of his father's remains and decided that it was necessary to build a permanent crypt for his father. Lincoln's coffin would be placed in a steel cage 10 feet (3.0 m) deep and encased in concrete in the floor of the tomb. On September 26, 1901, Lincoln's body was exhumed so that it could be re-interred in the newly built crypt. However, several of the 23 people present feared that his body might have been stolen in the intervening years, so they decided to open the coffin and check. [14]  A harsh choking smell arose when the casket was opened. Lincoln was perfectly recognizable, more than thirty years after his death. His face was a gold color from unhealed bruises, a result of contrecoup (injury on the opposite side of the head from point of impact) caused by the gunshot wound, which shattered the bones in his face and damaged the tissue. His hair, beard and mole were all perfectly preserved although his eyebrows were gone. His suit was covered with a yellow mold and his gloves had rotted on his hands. On his chest, they could see some bits of red fabric—remnants of the American flag with which he was buried, which had by then disintegrated. [14]  One of the last living persons to see the body, a youth of 14 at the time, was Fleetwood Lindley (1887–1963), who died on February 1, 1963. Three days before he died, Lindley was interviewed and confirmed his observations. [15] [14]  Another man, George Cashman, claimed to be the last living person to have viewed the remains of Abraham Lincoln. In the last years of his life,  Cashman was the curator of the National Landmark in Springfield called "Lincoln's Tomb." He particularly enjoyed relating his story to the more than one million visitors to the site each year. Cashman died in 1983. His claim concerning the viewing of Abraham Lincoln's remains was later refuted when his wife, Dorothy M. Cashman, wrote a pamphlet titled "The Lincoln Tomb." On page 14, Mrs. Cashman wrote, "At the time of his death in 1963 Fleetwood Lindley was the last living person to have looked upon Mr. Lincoln's face." [16] Second tomb reconstruction [ edit ] A second, major reconstruction of the tomb was undertaken in 1930–31. Much deterioration had occurred due to poor construction during the 1900–1901 reconstruction. During the second reconstruction, the entrance to the tomb was reconfigured to better accommodate visitors and the original, white marble sarcophagus was replaced with the red granite marker in front of the place where Lincoln is interred. Souvenir hunters destroyed the original sarcophagus, which was placed outside the tomb during reconstruction. The tomb was rededicated with President Herbert Hoover as the main speaker on June 17, 1931. [9]  Other movements [ edit ] Lincoln's coffin has been moved 17 times and the coffin opened 5 times. [17] The semi-circular Catacomb (or Burial Chamber) is at the north side of the base of the Lincoln Monument; on the south side (entrance) is Memorial Hall (or the Rotunda). Since the second reconstruction (1930–31) connecting corridors lead into the Burial Chamber.   Coffin placed  Remarks  Coffin opened   May 4, 1865  Coffin placed in Receiving Vault, Oak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Ill.  Yes   December 21, 1865  Coffin placed in nearby specially built Temporary Vault, Oak Ridge Cemetery.  Yes   September 19, 1871  Coffin placed in Lincoln Tomb (still under construction then), in temporary crypt in south wall Catacomb. The original walnut outer coffin is replaced by a new iron coffin.  Yes   October 9, 1874  Coffin placed in (white marble) sarcophagus in Catacomb, Lincoln Tomb. It is found that the iron coffin is too large to fit into the sarcophagus, so it is replaced with a new red cedar coffin. Lincoln Tomb was dedicated Oct 15, 1874.     November 7, 1876  Coffin partly lifted from sarcophagus during an attempted theft. The thieves only moved the coffin 18 inches [46 cm] when they were interrupted by police.     November 9, 1876  Coffin replaced in sarcophagus, which was then closed and sealed.     November 13, 1876  Coffin removed (daytime) to place near northwest wall Catacomb, to be transported later that day.     November 13, 1876  Coffin removed (nighttime) to secret location (eastside Lincoln Tomb, inside, near the base of the obelisk).     November 14, 1876  Coffin placed into wooden case at the secret location (eastside Lincoln Tomb, near the inside base of the obelisk).     November 18, 1878  Coffin replaced to another secret location (northside Lincoln Tomb, near the inside base of the obelisk).     November 20, 1878  Lincoln was exhumed and reburied at same secret location (northside Lincoln Tomb) in response to an anonymous threat, received by the caretaker of the tomb via a postcard. The coffin was untouched in the grave in which it was placed a mere two nights before.     April 14, 1887  Coffin removed to Memorial Hall for identification.  Yes   April 14, 1887  Coffin placed in newly built vault beneath floor of the Catacomb, Lincoln Tomb. After the coffins (of Lincoln and his wife) were lowered into the vault, it was filled with cement nearly in a liquid state, which in a short time hardened as a solid mass of stone, more than four feet and a half in depth over the top of the coffins. Over that the tessellated marble floor was relaid, and the sarcophagus placed in the original position.     March 10, 1900  Coffin removed to a temporary vault dug into the hillside behind the monument (i.e. a secret place a few yards northeast of Lincoln's Tomb) during tomb reconstruction, which started in 1899 and lasted 15 months. [18]      April 24, 1901  Coffin removed to reconstructed Lincoln Tomb.     July 10, 1901  Coffin temporarily removed to empty crypt in the south wall of the Catacomb in order to build a permanent crypt under the floor of the Catacomb.     September 26, 1901  Coffin brought to and opened in Memorial Hall, for identification  Yes   September 26, 1901  Coffin permanently placed in a steel cage, and embedded in concrete, 10 feet (3.0 m) deep under the floor of the Catacomb. The sarcophagus in front of the place where Lincoln is finally interred is empty. The original white marble sarcophagus was replaced in 1931 by the present red granite marker. It was not necessary to move Lincoln's body in the 1931 construction, because the cenotaph was placed 6 feet (1.8 m) and thirty inches (76 cm) south from the inside north wall, with foundation as low as that of Lincoln's grave.   Movements of remains of other family members [ edit ] On May 4, 1865, (Lincoln's arrival at Oak Ridge Cemetery, nineteen days after his death) another coffin, containing the body of Lincoln's son Willie (1850–1862) was placed with Lincoln's in the Receiving Vault. Willie had been initially interred in the Carroll family tomb at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown. His remains accompanied those of his father on the funeral train to Springfield. On December 21, 1865, the two caskets were moved to the temporary vault, halfway up the hillside, where the Lincoln Tomb was in construction at the top of the hill. The body of Lincoln's son Edward "Eddie" Baker Lincoln (three years, ten months) was already placed there on December 13, 1865. Eddie, born March 10, 1846, died February 1, 1850, and was first buried at the Hutchinson Cemetery in Springfield. The three bodies rested in the temporary vault while the Lincoln tomb was being built. The three bodies were moved to the catacomb of the tomb on September 19, 1871. They were not the first. Two months earlier (on July 17, 1871) it was Lincoln's son Thomas ("Tad") Lincoln, born April 4, 1853, who was the first Lincoln placed into a crypt in the Lincoln Tomb. Tad died on July 15, 1871, in Chicago, Illinois, aged eighteen. Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (December 13, 1818 – July 16, 1882). She was buried July 19, 1882, in one of the family crypts in the Lincoln Tomb. In the night of July 21, 1882, Mary Todd's casket was secretly taken from the crypt and at Robert Todd Lincoln's (her eldest son) request, buried alongside the President. On April 14, 1887, both caskets were moved to Memorial Hall. Lincoln's teenage grandson and namesake, Abraham Lincoln II ("Jack"), born August 14, 1873, died March 5, 1890, in London and was temporarily buried in Kensal Green Cemetery , London, until his father returned to the U.S. with his body and on November 8, 1890, was placed in one of the crypts in the Lincoln Tomb. His body remained in the tomb until May 27, 1930, when he was re-interred at the family plot of his father, Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843, to July 25, 1926), at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. During the first Lincoln Tomb reconstruction (1900–1901), the Lincoln family was disinterred and moved to the temporary vault northeast of the tomb. On April 24, 1901, the Lincoln family was removed from the temporary vault and placed back into the Lincoln Tomb. While President Lincoln was finally at rest, the remainder of the Lincoln family was moved two more times. The coffins containing the bodies of Mary, Eddie, Willie, and Tad Lincoln were removed during the second tomb reconstruction (1930–1931) from their crypts and transported to the Oak Ridge mausoleum, located near the south gate of the cemetery. After the second reconstruction was completed, the bodies were returned to their crypts in June 1931.

At the time, many people felt a theatre was not a proper place for a president to die.  The White House was only six blocks away—but a bumpy carriage ride on Washington’s unpaved streets might kill Lincoln immediately.  Soldiers carried Lincoln down the stairs of the theatre and out onto Tenth Street.  Standing on the Petersen boarding house stoop across the street, Henry Safford had heard the commotion. He knew that Willie Clark , a fellow boarder, was out for the night—and his room was vacant. He yelled to the soldiers, “Bring him in here!”  In the front parlor, First Lady Mary Lincoln awaited word of her husband, occasionally venturing in to visit him. In the back parlor, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton interrogated witnesses and directed the investigation.  Outside, thousands of people crowded onto Tenth Street and kept vigil through the night.  President Abraham Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865. Mary Lincoln was not in the room with him. Soldiers quickly removed his body to the White House for an autopsy and to prepare for a funeral.  At 11:00 a.m., Vice President Andrew Johnson took the oath of office as the 17th president.

Robinson  Emerick Hansell  Perpetrators John Wilkes Booth and co-conspirators Motive Revenge for the Confederate States  On April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln , the 16th president of the United States , was assassinated by well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth while attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Shot in the head as he watched the play, [2] Lincoln died the following day at 7:22 am in the Petersen House opposite the theater. [3] He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated. [4] His funeral and burial were marked by an extended period of national mourning. Near the end of the American Civil War , Lincoln's assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the federal government .
Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President  Andrew Johnson .
Beyond Lincoln's death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded, and Johnson's would-be attacker became drunk instead of killing the vice president. After a dramatic initial escape, Booth was killed at the end of a 12-day chase. Powell, Herold, Atzerodt, and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.  Background Abandoned plan to kidnap Lincoln The last known high-quality image of Lincoln, taken on the balcony at the White House, March 6, 1865 John Wilkes Booth , c. 1865 The Surratt house Booth was present as Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the assassination. John Wilkes Booth , born in Maryland into a family of prominent stage actors , had by the time of the assassination become a famous actor and national celebrity in his own right. He was also an outspoken Confederate sympathizer; in late 1860 he was initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore , Maryland. [5] : 67  In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant , commander of the Union armies, suspended the exchange of prisoners of war with the Confederate Army [6] to increase pressure on the manpower-starved South. Booth conceived a plan to kidnap Lincoln in order to blackmail the Union into resuming prisoner exchanges, [7] : 130–34 and recruited Samuel Arnold , George Atzerodt , David Herold , Michael O'Laughlen , Lewis Powell (also known as "Lewis Paine"), and John Surratt to help him. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt , left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland , and moved to a house in Washington, D.C. , where Booth became a frequent visitor. While Booth and Lincoln were not personally acquainted, Lincoln had seen Booth at Ford's Theatre in 1863. [8] : 419 [9] [10] After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln, who apparently harbored no suspicions about Booth, admired the actor and had repeatedly invited him (without success) to visit the White House . [11] : 325–26 Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865, writing in his diary afterwards: "What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!" [7] : 174, 437n41  On March 17, Booth and the other conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he returned from a play at Campbell General Hospital in northwest Washington. But Lincoln did not go to the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel . [7] : 185 Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the abortive kidnap attempt, might have been able to attack Lincoln at the hotel. [7] : 185–86, 439n17 [12] : 25  Meanwhile, the Confederacy was collapsing. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia , the Confederate capital, fell to the Union Army . On April 9, General  Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia  surrendered to General  Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Appomattox Court House . Confederate President  Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials had fled. Nevertheless, Booth continued to believe in the Confederate cause and sought a way to salvage it. Booth decided to murder Lincoln.

In a letter to his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. [14]  Doris Kearns Goodwin has endorsed the idea that another factor was Booth's rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth , who was a loyal Unionist. [15]  David S. Reynolds believes that, despite disagreeing with his cause, Booth greatly admired the abolitionist  John Brown ; [16] Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: "John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!" [16] [17]  On April 11, Booth attended Lincoln's last speech, in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for emancipated slaves; [18] Booth said,
"That means nigger citizenship.  ... That is the last speech he will ever give." [19] Enraged, Booth urged Powell to shoot Lincoln on the spot. Whether Booth made this request because he was not armed or considered Powell a better shot than himself (Powell, unlike Booth, had served in the Confederate Army and thus had military experience) is unknown. In any event, Powell refused for fear of the crowd, and Booth was either unable or unwilling to personally attempt to kill the president. However, Booth said to David Herold, "By God, I'll put him through." [20] [8] : 91  Lincoln's premonitions According to Ward Hill Lamon , three days before his death, Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds: I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered. There I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. "Who is dead in the White House?" I demanded of one of the soldiers, "The President," was his answer; "he was killed by an assassin." [21] However, Lincoln went on to tell Lamon that "In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else." [22] [23] Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell writes that dreams of assassination would not be unexpected in the first place, considering the Baltimore Plot and an additional assassination attempt in which a hole was shot through Lincoln's hat. [22]  For months Lincoln had looked pale and haggard, but on the morning of the assassination he told people how happy he was. First Lady  Mary Lincoln felt such talk could bring bad luck. [24] : 346 Lincoln told his cabinet that he had dreamed of being on a "singular and indescribable vessel that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore", and that he had had the same dream before "nearly every great and important event of the War" such as the Union victories at Antietam , Murfreesboro , Gettysburg and Vicksburg . [25]  Preparations Advertisement for Our American Cousin (Washington Evening Star , April 14, 1865) On April 14, Booth's morning started at midnight. He wrote his mother that all was well but that he was "in haste". In his diary, he wrote that "Our cause being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done". [13] : 728 [24] : 346  While visiting Ford's Theatre around noon to pick up his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to visit the theater that evening for a performance of Our American Cousin . This provided him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familiar to its staff. [12] : 12 [8] : 108–09 Booth went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C., and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern. [12] : 19  Ford's Theatre The conspirators met for the final time at 8:45  pm. Booth assigned Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward at his home, Atzerodt to kill Vice President  Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to a rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. Booth was the only well-known member of the conspiracy. Access to the theater's upper floor containing the Presidential Box was restricted, and Booth was the only plotter who could have realistically expected to be admitted there without difficulty. Furthermore, it would have been reasonable (but ultimately incorrect) for the plotters to have assumed that the entrance of the box would itself be guarded. Had it been, Booth would have been the only plotter with a plausible chance of gaining access to the President, or at least to gain entry to the box without being searched for weapons first. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln at point-blank range with his single-shot Philadelphia Deringer  pistol and then stab Grant at the theater. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. [8] : 112 Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue. [7] : 212  Assassination of Lincoln Lincoln's box Lincoln arrives at the theater Despite what Booth had heard earlier in the day, Grant and his wife, Julia Grant , had declined to accompany the Lincolns, as Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant were not on good terms. [26] : 45 [b] Others in succession also declined the Lincolns' invitation, until finally Major  Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris (daughter of U.S. Senator  Ira Harris of New York ) accepted. [12] : 32 At one point, Mary developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. [28] Lincoln's footman , William H. Crook , advised him not to go, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife. [29] Lincoln told Speaker of the House  Schuyler Colfax , "I suppose it's time to go though I would rather stay" before assisting Mary into the carriage. The presidential party arrived late and settled into their box (two adjoining boxes with a dividing partition removed). The play was interrupted, and the orchestra played " Hail to the Chief " as the full house of some 1,700 rose in applause. [30] Lincoln sat in a rocking chair that had been selected for him from among the Ford family's personal furnishings. [31] [32]  Booth's Philadelphia Deringer The cast modified a line of the play in honor of Lincoln: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the reply – scripted as, "Well, you're not the only one that wants to escape the draft " – was delivered instead as, "The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!" [33] A member of the audience observed that Mary Lincoln often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and "seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment." [34]  At one point, Mary whispered to Lincoln, who was holding her hand, "What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?" Lincoln replied, "She won't think anything about it". [12] : 39 In following years, these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem . [35]  Booth shoots Lincoln This Currier & Ives print (1865) implies Rathbone was already rising as Booth fired; in fact, Rathbone was unaware of Booth until he heard the shot. With Crook off duty and Ward Hill Lamon away, policeman John Frederick Parker was assigned to guard the Presidential Box. [36] At intermission he went to a nearby tavern along with Lincoln's valet, Charles Forbes, and Coachman Francis Burke. It was also the same tavern Booth was waiting by having several drinks to prepare his time. It is unclear whether Parker returned to the theater, but he was certainly not at his post when Booth entered the box. [37] In any event, there is no certainty that entry would have been denied to a celebrity such as Booth. Booth had prepared a brace to bar the door after entering the box, indicating that he expected a guard. After spending time at the tavern, Booth entered Ford's Theatre one last time at about 10:10 pm, this time through the theater's front entrance. He passed through the dress circle and went to the door that led to the Presidential Box after showing Charles Forbes his calling card. Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd saw Booth arrive: [38]  About 10:25 pm, a man came in and walked slowly along the side on which the "Pres" box was and I heard a man say, "There's Booth" and I turned my head to look at him. He was still walking very slow and was near the box door when he stopped, took a card from his pocket, wrote something on it, and gave it to the usher who took it to the box. In a minute the door was opened and he walked in. Once inside the hallway, Booth barricaded the door by wedging a stick between it and the wall. From here, a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door. [39] [40] : 173  Washington Metropolitan Police De­part­ment blotter for April 14 (lower quarter of page): "At this hour the mel­an­choly intel­li­gence of the assas­si­na­tion of Mr. Lincoln  ... was brought to this office  ... the assassin is a man named J. Wilks [ sic ] Booth." Booth knew the play Our American Cousin by heart and waited to time his shot at about 10:15 pm, with the laughter at one of the hilarious lines of the play, delivered by actor Harry Hawk : "Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!". Lincoln was laughing at this line [41] : 96 when Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with his pistol. [2]  The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, and came to rest near the front of the skull after fracturing both orbital plates . [c] [44] Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. [46] [47] Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like "Freedom!" [48]  Booth escapes Booth's dagger Rathbone jumped from his seat and struggled with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife with which he stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as he prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; [49] Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box , and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought he was part of the play. Booth held his bloody knife over his head and yelled something to the audience. While it is traditionally held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis ! ("Thus always to tyrants") either from the box or the stage, witness accounts conflict. [13] : 739 Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but others – including Booth himself – said he yelled only Sic semper! [50] [51] (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted next, in English: either "The South is avenged!", [12] : 48 "Revenge for the South!", or "The South shall be free!" (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: "I have done it!") Immediately after Booth landed on the stage, Major Joseph B. Stewart climbed over the orchestra pit and footlights and pursued Booth across the stage. [49] The screams of Mary Lincoln and Clara Harris, and Rathbone's cries of, "Stop that man!" [12] : 49 prompted others to join the chase as pandemonium broke out. Booth exited the theater through a side door, en route stabbing orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. [52] [53] As he leapt into the saddle of his getaway horse Booth pushed away Joseph Burroughs, [a] who had been holding the horse, striking Burroughs with the handle of his knife. [54] [55] [56] [1]  Death of Lincoln Surgeon Charles Leale Charles Leale , a young Union Army surgeon, pushed through the crowd to the door of the Presidential Box, but could not open it until Rathbone, inside, noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed the door shut. [8] : 120  Leale found Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right [43] as Mary held him and sobbed: "His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous ." [57] [58] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft , was lifted into the box from the stage. After Leale and bystander William Kent cut away Lincoln's collar while unbuttoning his coat and shirt and found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed but dislodged a blood clot , after which Lincoln's breathing improved; [8] : 121–22 he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. After giving Lincoln artificial respiration , Leale allowed actress Laura Keene to cradle the President's head in her lap. He pronounced the wound mortal. [12] : 78  Skull fragments and probe used. Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King , decided that Lincoln must be moved to the nearest house on Tenth Street because a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. Carefully, seven men picked up Lincoln and slowly carried him out of the theater, where it was packed with an angry mob. After considering Peter Taltavull 's Star Saloon next door, they concluded that they would take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It was raining as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street, [59] where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen . [60] In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on a small bed. [8] : 123–24  Lincoln's deathbed [d] After clearing everyone out of the room, including Mrs. Lincoln, the doctors cut away Lincoln's clothes but discovered no other wounds; finding that Lincoln was cold, they applied hot water bottles and mustard plasters while covering his cold body with blankets. Later, more physicians arrived: Surgeon General  Joseph K. Barnes , Charles Henry Crane , Anderson Ruffin Abbott , and Robert K. Stone (Lincoln's personal physician). All agreed Lincoln could not survive. Barnes probed the wound, locating the bullet and some bone fragments. Throughout the night, as the hemorrhage continued, they removed blood clots to relieve pressure on the brain, [62] and Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, "to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend." [8] : 14 [63]  The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln ( Alonzo Chappel , 1868) [e] Lincoln's older son Robert Todd Lincoln arrived at about 11 pm, but twelve-year-old Tad Lincoln , who was watching a play of Aladdin at Grover's Theater when he learned of his father's assassination, was kept away. Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles and Secretary of War  Edwin M. Stanton arrived. Stanton insisted that the sobbing Mrs. Lincoln leave the sick room, then for the rest of the night he essentially ran the United States government from the house, including directing the hunt for Booth and the other conspirators. [8] : 127–28 Guards kept the public away, but numerous officials and physicians were admitted to pay their respects. [62]  "The following notes, taken by Dr. Abbott , show the condition of the President throughout the night" ( Evening Star , Washington D.C., April 15, 1865); [64] Abbott was a black doctor from Toronto who had served in the Union Army [65] Initially, Lincoln's features were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later, one of his eyes became swollen and the right side of his face discolored. [66]  Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that Lincoln then started "breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering." [67] [68] As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became "perfectly natural" [67] (except for the discoloration around his eyes). [69] Shortly before 7  am Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, [70] and, as Dixon reported, "she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name." [71]  Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. [3] Mary Lincoln was not present. [72] [73] In his last moments, Lincoln's face became calm and his breathing quieter. [74] Field wrote there was "no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat ... [only] a mere cessation of breathing". [67] [68] According to Lincoln's secretary John Hay , at the moment of Lincoln's death, "a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features". [75] The assembly knelt for a prayer, after which Stanton said either, "Now he belongs to the ages" or, "Now he belongs to the angels." [8] : 134 [76]  On Lincoln's death, Vice President Johnson became the 17th president of the United States. The presidential oath of office was administered to Johnson by Chief Justice  Salmon Chase sometime between 10 and 11  am. [77]  Powell attacks Seward An artist's depiction of Lewis Powell attacking William Seward 's son, Frederick W. Seward Booth had assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward. On the night of the assassination, Seward was at his home on Lafayette Square , confined to bed and recovering from injuries sustained on April 5 from being thrown from his carriage. Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy, and popular gun during the Civil War) and a Bowie knife . William Bell , Seward's maître d' , answered the door when Powell knocked 10:10  pm, as Booth made his way to the Presidential Box at Ford's Theater. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. [12] : 54 [13] : 736 [78] At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State  Frederick W. Seward , to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep. William and Fanny Seward in 1861 Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, "Fred, Father is awake now" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver. He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired, so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling "Murder! Murder!", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again, and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek. [12] : 58 However, the splint (often mistakenly described as a neck brace ) that doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. [13] : 737 Seward eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face. Seward's son Augustus and Sergeant George F. Robinson , a soldier assigned to Seward, were alerted by Fanny's screams and received stab wounds in struggling with Powell. As Augustus went for a pistol, Powell ran downstairs toward the door, [79] : 275 where he encountered Emerick Hansell, a State Department messenger. [80] [81] Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, then ran outside exclaiming, "I'm mad! I'm mad!" Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city. [12] : 59  Atzerodt fails to attack Johnson Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson, who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to Johnson's room at 10:15 pm and shoot him. [13] : 735 On April 14, Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day, he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior. He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 am, where he obtained a room and went to sleep. [8] : 166–67 [79] : 335  Earlier in the day, Booth had stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: "I don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth." [78] One theory holds that Booth was trying to find out whether Johnson was expected at the Kirkwood that night; [8] : 111 another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy. [82]  Conspiracy to kill the Vice President     George Atzerodt        Andrew Johnson        "Don't wish to disturb you Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth"    Reactions Further information: Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln Lincoln's funeral train Lincoln was mourned in both the North and South, [79] : 350 and indeed around the world. [83] Numerous foreign governments issued proclamations and declared periods of mourning on April 15. [84] [85] Lincoln was praised in sermons on Easter Sunday , which fell on the day after his death. [79] : 357  On April 18, mourners lined up seven abreast for a mile to view Lincoln in his walnut casket in the White House's black-draped East Room . Special trains brought thousands from other cities, some of whom slept on the Capitol 's lawn. [86] : 120–23 Hundreds of thousands watched the funeral procession on April 19, [12] : 213 and millions more lined the 1,700-mile (2,700 km) route of the train which took Lincoln's remains through New York to Springfield , Illinois , often passing trackside tributes in the form of bands, bonfires, and hymn-singing. [87] : 31–58 [41] : 231–38  "The Apotheosis of Lincoln": Lincoln ascending to heaven, where George Washington embraces him and crowns him with laurels. (Unknown artist) Poet Walt Whitman composed " When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd ", " O Captain! My Captain! ", and two other poems, to eulogize Lincoln. [88] [89]  Ulysses S. Grant called Lincoln "incontestably the greatest man I ever knew." [13] : 747 Robert E. Lee expressed sadness. [90] Southern-born Elizabeth Blair said that "Those of Southern born sympathies know now they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again." [13] : 744 African-American orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an "unspeakable calamity". [90]  British Foreign Secretary  Lord Russell called Lincoln's death a "sad calamity." [85]  China 's chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, Prince Kung , described himself as "inexpressibly shocked and startled". [84]  Ecuadorian president Gabriel García Moreno said, "Never should I have thought that the noble country of Washington would be humiliated by such a black and horrible crime; nor should I ever have thought that Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country with such wisdom and glory under so critical circumstances." [84] [85] The government of Liberia issued a proclamation calling Lincoln "not only the ruler of his own people, but a father to millions of a race stricken and oppressed." [85] The government of Haiti condemned the assassination as a "horrid crime". [85]  Flight and capture of the conspirators Booth's escape route Booth and Herold Within half an hour of fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth crossed the Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland. [12] : 67–68 A Union Army sentry named Silas Cobb questioned him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he was going home to the nearby town of Charles. Although it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 pm, the sentry let him through. [91] Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later [12] : 81–82 and rendezvoused with Booth. [12] : 87 After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville, Herold and Booth rode to the home of Samuel A. Mudd , a local doctor, who splinted the leg [12] : 131, 153 Booth had broken in his escape and later made a pair of crutches for Booth. [12] : 131, 153  After a day at Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man to guide them to Samuel Cox's house . [12] : 163 Cox, in turn, took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River . [12] : 224 On the afternoon of April 24, they arrived at the farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia . Booth told Garrett he was a wounded Confederate soldier. Reward broadside with photographs of John H. Surratt , John Wilkes Booth , and David E. Herold An April 15 letter to Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd from his brother tells of the rumors in Washington about Booth: Today all the city is in mourning nearly every house being in black and I have not seen a smile, no business, and many a strong man I have seen in tears – Some reports say Booth is a prisoner, others that he has made his escape – but from orders received here, I believe he is taken, and during the night will be put on a Monitor for safe keeping – as a mob once raised now would know no end. [38]  The hunt for the conspirators quickly became the largest in U.S. history, involving thousands of federal troops and countless civilians. Edwin M. Stanton personally directed the operation, [92] authorizing rewards of $50,000 (equivalent to $1,000,000 in 2022) for Booth and $25,000 each for Herold and John Surratt. [93]  Booth and Herold were sleeping at Garrett's farm on April 26 when soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry arrived and surrounded the barn, then threatened to set fire to it. Herold surrendered, but Booth cried out, "I will not be taken alive!" [12] : 326 The soldiers set fire to the barn [12] : 331 and Booth scrambled for the back door with a rifle and pistol. Sergeant Boston Corbett crept up behind the barn and shot Booth in "the back of the head about an inch below the spot where his [Booth's] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln", [94] severing his spinal cord. [12] : 335 Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, "Tell my mother I die for my country." Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: "Useless ... useless." He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. [12] : 336–40 [78] Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders from Stanton that Booth be taken alive if possible, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public. [41] : 228  Others The Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died April 26 Without Herold to guide him, Powell did not find his way back to the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a ditch-digger hired by Mary Surratt, but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. [8] : 174–79 George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland , about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Washington, where he was arrested April 20. [8] : 169  The remaining conspirators were arrested by month's end – except for John Surratt , who fled to Quebec where Roman Catholic priests hid him. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England , staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States . A friend from his school days recognized him there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by an agent of the United States in Egypt in November 1866. [95] Conspirators' trial and execution Portraits of the conspirators (excepting Mudd) from Benn Pitman 's The assassination of President Lincoln and the trial of the conspirators Scores of persons were arrested, including many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had even the slightest contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann , a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati at the time of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford ; James Pumphrey , from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd , the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac. [86] : 186–88 All were eventually released except: [86] : 188   Samuel Arnold  George Atzerodt  David Herold  Samuel Mudd  Michael O'Laughlen  Lewis Powell  Edmund Spangler (a theater stagehand who had given Booth's horse to Burroughs to hold)  Mary Surratt The accused were tried by a military tribunal ordered by Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death:  Maj. Gen.  David Hunter (presiding)  Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace  Brig. Gen.  Robert Sanford Foster  Brev. Maj. Gen. Thomas Maley Harris  Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe  Brig. Gen. August Kautz  Col.  James A. Ekin  Col. Charles H. Tompkins  Lt. Col.  David Ramsay Clendenin Trial of the conspirators, June 5, 1865 The prosecution was led by U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt , assisted by Congressman  John A. Bingham and Major  Henry Lawrence Burnett . [96]  The use of a military tribunal provoked criticism from former Attorney General  Edward Bates and Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles , who believed that a civil court should have presided, but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force at the time in the District of Columbia . (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan , the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) [8] : 213–14 Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson. [8] : 222–23  Execution of Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. The seven-week trial included the testimony of 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging ; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life in prison. [97] Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter. [8] : 227  Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. [12] : 362, 365 Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the United States government. [98] O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. [12] : 367 Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse. [ citation needed ]  John Surratt stood trial in Washington in 1867. Four residents of Elmira, New York , [12] : 27 [99] : 125, 132, 136–37 [100] : 112–15 claimed they had seen him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) on the day of the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict, and John Surratt was released.

[1]   ^  There is evidence to suggest that either Booth or fellow conspirator Michael O'Laughlen – who resembled Booth – followed the Grants to Union Station late that afternoon and discovered that they would not be at the theater. The Grants later received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to have boarded their train intending to attack them but was thwarted because the Grants' private car was locked and guarded. [27]   ^  Though the steel ball Booth used as a bullet was of a .41 caliber , the deringer type was a small, easily concealable gun known to be inaccurate and usually just used in close quarters. [42] The bullet most probably passed mainly through the left side of the brain, causing massive damage including the skull fractures, hemorrhaging , and secondary severe edema of the brain. While Dr. Leale's notes mention Lincoln's bulging right eye, [43] the autopsy only specifically states the damage to the left side of the brain.

Funeral services, a procession, and a lying in state were first held in Washington, D.C. , then a funeral train transported Lincoln's remains 1,654 miles (2,662 km) through seven states for burial in Springfield, Illinois .  Never exceeding 20 mph, the train made several stops in principal cities and state capitals for processions, orations, and additional lyings in state. Millions of Americans viewed the train along the route and participated in associated ceremonies. The train left Washington, on April 21 at 12:30  pm. It bore Lincoln's eldest son Robert Todd and the remains of Lincoln's younger son, William Wallace Lincoln (1850–1862), [a] but not Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln , who was too distraught to make the trip. [2] The train largely retraced the route Lincoln had traveled to Washington as the president-elect on his way to his first inauguration , more than four years earlier. The train arrived at Springfield on May 3. Lincoln was interred on May 4, at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield. Every town the train passed or stopped in there was always a crowd to pay their respects. By 1874, several features had been added to the Lincoln Tomb , including a 117-foot (36 m)-tall granite  obelisk surrounded with several bronze statues of Lincoln and soldiers and sailors. Mary Todd Lincoln and three of their four sons—Willie, Eddie , and Tad —are also buried there. [b] Today, it is owned and managed as a state historic site .  Washington, D.C. [ edit ] After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth , Lincoln's body was carried by an honor guard to the White House on Saturday April 15, 1865. He lay in state in the East Room of the White House which was open to the public on Tuesday, April 18. On April 19, a funeral service was held and then the coffin, attended by large crowds, was transported in a procession down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol Rotunda , where a ceremonial burial service was held. The body again lay in state on the 20th and on the early morning of the following day a prayer service was held for the Lincoln cabinet officials. [4]  Funeral train to Springfield, Illinois [ edit ] Lincoln's funeral train At 7  a.m. on Friday, April 21, the Lincoln coffin was taken by honor guard to the depot. Cabinet secretaries Edwin M. Stanton , Gideon Welles , Hugh McCulloch , and John Palmer Usher , as well as, generals Ulysses S. Grant , and Montgomery C. Meigs left the escort at the depot, and at 8  a.m. the train departed. At least 10,000 people witnessed the train's departure from Washington. Lincoln's house draped in mourning with his horse "Old Robin" in front, Springfield, Illinois, 1865 The funeral train had nine cars, including a baggage car, hearse car, and the President's car, built for use by the president and other officials and containing a parlor, sitting room, and sleeping apartment. The President's car was draped in mourning and carried the coffins of Lincoln and his son. New locomotives were substituted at several points. The Department of War designated the route and declared the railroads used as military roads. Only persons authorized by the State Department were allowed to travel on the train, which was limited to 20 miles (32 km) an hour for safety. A pilot train preceded it to ensure the track was clear. Five relatives and family friends were appointed to accompany the funeral train: David Davis , Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States ; Lincoln's brothers-in-law, Ninian Wirt Edwards and C. M. Smith; Brigadier General John Blair Smith Todd , a cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln; and Charles Alexander Smith, the brother of C. M. Smith. An honor guard accompanied the train; this consisted of Union Army  Major General  David Hunter ; brevet Major General John G. Barnard ; Brigadier Generals Edward D. Townsend , Charles Thomas Campbell , Amos Beebe Eaton , John C. Caldwell , Alfred Terry , George D. Ramsey, and Daniel McCallum; Union Navy  Rear Admiral  Charles Henry Davis and Captain  William Rogers Taylor ; and Marine Corps  Major Thomas H. Field. Four accompanied the train in a logistics capacity: Captain Charles Penrose, as quartermaster and commissary of subsistence; Ward Hill Lamon , Lincoln's longtime bodyguard and friend and U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia; and Dr. Charles B. Brown and Frank T. Sands, embalmer and undertaker , respectively. [5]  Governor  Oliver P. Morton of Indiana ; Governor  John Brough of Ohio ; and Governor  William M. Stone of Iowa accompanied the train with their aides. [5]  Lincoln's funeral train was the first national commemoration of a president's death by rail. Lincoln was observed, mourned, and honored by the citizens and visitors of Washington, Maryland , Pennsylvania , New York , Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois in the following cities:   City  Arrive  Lying in state in   Public viewing from / until   Depart  Image   Washington, D.C.

Two future presidents viewed the train, Theodore Roosevelt in New York and Grover Cleveland in Buffalo. [6]  Remarks Remark #1: April 15–19, 1865: body of the deceased president in the White House; shortly after 9 o'clock Saturday morning (April 15, 1865) the remains were placed in a temporary coffin, under the direction of undertaker Frank T. Sands, and removed to the White House, six young men of the quartermaster's department carrying the body. An escort of cavalry Union Light Guard, under the command of Lieutenant James B. Jameson, accompanied the remains, which were followed by Generals Augur, commanding Department of Washington; Rucker, depot quartermaster, Colonel Pelouze, of the War Department, Captain Finley Anderson, A.A.G. Hancock's corps, Captain D.G. Thomas, clothing depot, Captain J.H. Crowell and Captain C. Baker, all walking bareheaded. The hearse moved slowly up 10th street to G, and thence to the White House (east gate). [7] The martyred president's autopsy was performed in a second floor guest room by army pathologist J. Janvier Woodward and his assistant Edward Curtis; also present: Surgeon General Dr. Joseph K. Barnes, Dr. Robert King Stone, Dr. Charles Sabin Taft, General Dr. Charles H. Crane, assistant surgeon William Morrow Notson, General Rucker and Lincoln's friend Orville H. Browning. After the autopsy Lincoln's body was brought (Monday evening, April 17) to the great East Room; the room was draped with crape and black cloth, relieved only here and there by white flowers and green leaves. The catafalque upon which the casket lay was about fifteen feet high, and consisted of an elevated platform resting on a dais and covered with a domed canopy of black cloth which was supported by four pillars, and was lined beneath with fluted white silk... From the time the body had been made ready for burial until the last services in the house, it was watched night and day by a guard of honor, the members of which were one major-general, one brigadier-general, two field officers, and four line officers of the army and four of the navy. The room was darkened — a sort of chapelle ardente. April 19: a short service was held in the Green Room Military units marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. during the state funeral for Abraham Lincoln on April 19, 1865 Remark #2: April 19–21, 1865: lying in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda. Arrival: April 19, 1865, 3  p.m. The procession started from the White House at 2  p.m. and proceeded up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol amidst the tolling of bells and the firing of minute-guns. The funeral car was large. The lower base was fourteen feet [4.2 m] long and seven feet [2.1 m] wide, and eight feet [2.4 m] from the ground. The upper base, upon which the coffin rested, was eleven feet [3.4 m] long and five feet [1.5 m] below the top of the canopy. The canopy was surmounted by a gilt eagle, covered with crape. The hearse was entirely covered with cloth, velvet, crape and alpaca. The seat was covered with cloth, and on each side was a splendid lamp. The car was fifteen feet [4.6 m] high, and the coffin was so placed as to afford a full view to all spectators. It was drawn by six gray horses, each attended by a groom. The avenue was cleared the whole length... The sound of muffled drums was heard, and the procession, with a slow and measured tread, moved from the home of mourning on its mission with the remains of the illustrious dead. Despite the enormous crowd the silence was profound. The funeral car was carried up the steps of the Capitol, beneath the spot where, six weeks before, the president had delivered his second Inaugural, and into the rotunda, where the body was removed from the car to another catafalque, where a service was read. Here the procession dispersed, leaving the remains of the president in the rotunda, where they were open to view the next day—The public viewing started April 20, 1865 (early morning)-- Depart from U.S. Capitol: April 21, 1865, 7  a.m.; coffin moved to Washington's Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Depot  Remark #3: Michigan City, Ind. was a 35 min. stop; Lincoln's funeral train was forced to wait here for a committee of more than one hundred important men from Chicago, who were coming out to escort the train into their city; citizens of Michigan City held an impromptu funeral (patriotic organizations conducted memorial services and 16 young women were permitted to enter the funeral car; flowers were placed on the coffin) –  Commemoration [ edit ] There is an immersive laying in state exhibit in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, IL.  The exhibit is a full scale recreation of the Representative's Hall in the Old State Capital Building in Springfield.  It is based on period photographs and etchings, as well as reporter's descriptions.  The hall depicts the moment Lincoln was laid in state there, with lavish, elaborate, and sometimes odd decorations, including a replica black casket. [8]  Burial site selection [ edit ] The Mather Vault Shortly after Lincoln's death, a delegation of Illinois citizens (later forming the National Lincoln Monument Association ) asked Mrs. Lincoln to return her husband's remains to Springfield for burial. She agreed, and the group then researched various sites in and around Springfield, selecting a centrally located, hilltop site known as Mather Block, and a temporary receiving vault was built there. However, Mrs. Lincoln selected Oak Ridge Cemetery for her husband's burial. Despite repeated attempts by the association to change the location of the burial to Mather Block, she remained firm in her decision. [9]  Springfield's choice: The Mather Vault [ edit ] A large number of Illinois politicians were in Washington when Lincoln was assassinated, including the Governor , Richard J. Oglesby , a close friend of Lincoln. A few hours after Lincoln's death they met in Sen. Richard Yates' room at the National Hotel , to arrange a burial in Springfield, Illinois. Governor Oglesby was selected to confer with the Lincoln family on a burial place. Informal conferences were held on April 16. Mary Lincoln was not receiving visitors, but she preferred Chicago or the empty crypt in the U.S. Capitol that had been prepared for George Washington. She finally relented when her son Robert Todd Lincoln was able to persuade her to allow a Springfield burial, by promising to take Willie Lincoln's body along. Springfield wanted a prominent burial location, a location that would draw visitors into downtown Springfield. A 6-acre (24,000 m 2 ) block, owned by the family of Col. Thomas Mather, was selected, a plot that could be seen from the major railroad line (Chicago and Alton Railroad), a plot in the center of Springfield on a hill. Fifty thousand dollars were donated for the purchase and the work of constructing a temporary vault started immediately. The vault was designed to be a resting place for the remains until a grand monument could be erected. By men working night and day, through sunshine and rain, it was ready for use on May 24 (the day of the burial), although the work was not quite completed on the outside. The Mather Block of land was later used as the site of the Illinois State Capitol building. [10]  Mary Lincoln's choice: Oak Ridge Cemetery [ edit ] Oak Ridge receiving vault Mary Lincoln however recalled that Lincoln once had said that he wanted a quiet place for his burial at Oak Ridge (said to her on May 24, 1860, when Lincoln, then running for president, and Mary attended the dedication of Oak Ridge, a rural quiet cemetery, two miles (3.2 km) from the heart of Springfield). On April 28 Mary sent a message to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton , in which she stated that her decision was final and that Lincoln's remains must be placed in the Oak Ridge Cemetery. On April 29 another message followed: "arrangements for using the Mather vault must be changed." And on May 1 the message was: "the remains of the president should be placed in the vault of Oak Ridge and nowhere else." The Oak Ridge vault was readied, but work on the Mather vault continued as a "contingency." [11]  Even after the burial, the debate was not over. The National Lincoln Monument Association began again to stoke the fires of creating the grand tomb for Lincoln at the Mather Block. Mary Lincoln threatened to have her husband's remains taken to Chicago or Washington for permanent burial. "My determination is unalterable," she wrote on June 10 and demanded a formal promise that "the immortal Savior and Martyr for Freedom" would be at Oak Ridge, and imposed a deadline of June 15 before she would make good on her threat. The association voted, on the evening before the deadline, by the narrowest of margins, 8–7, to accept her demands. Oak Ridge Cemetery became the site of the Lincoln Tomb. Attempted theft and movement of remains [ edit ] Attempted theft [ edit ] When the tomb was completed in 1874, Lincoln's coffin was placed in a white marble sarcophagus in a burial room behind a steel gate locked with a padlock. In November 1876, Chicago counterfeiter James "Big Jim" Kennally planned to steal Lincoln's body and hold it in exchange for a pardon for his engraver (who was serving a ten-year sentence at Illinois State Penitentiary ) and $200,000 (approximately $5,496,000 today). [12] [13] The plot failed when two men recruited to assist turned out to be paid government informants, [12] [13] and the men sent to get the body did not plan for how to remove the quarter-ton cedar-and-lead coffin from the grounds. [13]  On November 13, 1876, tomb custodian John Carroll Power and a group of trusted confidants moved the coffin from its room to a secret location in the basement of the tomb. [13] Finding the ground waterlogged, they temporarily set the coffin on the ground and disguised it under a wood pile. Moving the coffin proved difficult; it weighed some 400–500 pounds (180–230 kilograms) and Power and the members of the Monument Association were mostly in their 60s (the youngest was 56). They were relieved to find that the seals on the coffin were intact and that Lincoln's remains had not been disturbed. The following July, Kennally or some other member of the conspiracy asked Power to bury the coffin. He said that the unventilated basement was almost impossible to enter in the summer weather and also moving the heavy coffin had been brutally hard on himself and the other aging Monument Association members. Power, who had recently celebrated his 70th birthday, said that he suffered from crippling pain for months afterward and had no desire to do it again. The coffin therefore sat in the basement for another year. Finally, a group of men in their 30s were hired to move the coffin and on November 18, 1878, the coffin was moved and reburied in a shallow grave on the far end of the labyrinth. After receiving anonymous threats in the mail, the coffin was dug up two days later to make sure it was still there. [12]  In 1880, Power and his associates formed the "Lincoln Guard of Honor" to serve as the custodians of Lincoln's remains. Other than its members, only Robert Todd Lincoln knew of this organization. In 1882, after Mary Todd Lincoln died, Robert instructed the Guard of Honor to bury his mother's coffin wherever they kept his father's. Both coffins remained in the basement until 1887, when they were encased in a brick vault, at which time Lincoln's coffin was opened to verify his remains were still there. [12]  Tomb reconstruction and exhumation [ edit ] The original tomb, built on unsuitable soil, was in constant need of repair. In 1900, a complete reconstruction was undertaken, Lincoln's remains were exhumed, and the coffin was placed back in the white marble sarcophagus. [12] On April 25, 1901, upon completion of the reconstruction, Robert Todd Lincoln visited the tomb. He was unhappy with the disposition of his father's remains and decided that it was necessary to build a permanent crypt for his father. Lincoln's coffin would be placed in a steel cage 10 feet (3.0 m) deep and encased in concrete in the floor of the tomb. On September 26, 1901, Lincoln's body was exhumed so that it could be re-interred in the newly built crypt. However, several of the 23 people present feared that his body might have been stolen in the intervening years, so they decided to open the coffin and check. [14]  A harsh choking smell arose when the casket was opened. Lincoln was perfectly recognizable, more than thirty years after his death. His face was a gold color from unhealed bruises, a result of contrecoup (injury on the opposite side of the head from point of impact) caused by the gunshot wound, which shattered the bones in his face and damaged the tissue. His hair, beard and mole were all perfectly preserved although his eyebrows were gone. His suit was covered with a yellow mold and his gloves had rotted on his hands. On his chest, they could see some bits of red fabric—remnants of the American flag with which he was buried, which had by then disintegrated. [14]  One of the last living persons to see the body, a youth of 14 at the time, was Fleetwood Lindley (1887–1963), who died on February 1, 1963. Three days before he died, Lindley was interviewed and confirmed his observations. [15] [14]  Another man, George Cashman, claimed to be the last living person to have viewed the remains of Abraham Lincoln. In the last years of his life,  Cashman was the curator of the National Landmark in Springfield called "Lincoln's Tomb." He particularly enjoyed relating his story to the more than one million visitors to the site each year. Cashman died in 1983. His claim concerning the viewing of Abraham Lincoln's remains was later refuted when his wife, Dorothy M. Cashman, wrote a pamphlet titled "The Lincoln Tomb." On page 14, Mrs. Cashman wrote, "At the time of his death in 1963 Fleetwood Lindley was the last living person to have looked upon Mr. Lincoln's face." [16] Second tomb reconstruction [ edit ] A second, major reconstruction of the tomb was undertaken in 1930–31. Much deterioration had occurred due to poor construction during the 1900–1901 reconstruction. During the second reconstruction, the entrance to the tomb was reconfigured to better accommodate visitors and the original, white marble sarcophagus was replaced with the red granite marker in front of the place where Lincoln is interred. Souvenir hunters destroyed the original sarcophagus, which was placed outside the tomb during reconstruction. The tomb was rededicated with President Herbert Hoover as the main speaker on June 17, 1931. [9]  Other movements [ edit ] Lincoln's coffin has been moved 17 times and the coffin opened 5 times. [17] The semi-circular Catacomb (or Burial Chamber) is at the north side of the base of the Lincoln Monument; on the south side (entrance) is Memorial Hall (or the Rotunda). Since the second reconstruction (1930–31) connecting corridors lead into the Burial Chamber.   Coffin placed  Remarks  Coffin opened   May 4, 1865  Coffin placed in Receiving Vault, Oak Ridge Cemetery, Springfield, Ill.  Yes   December 21, 1865  Coffin placed in nearby specially built Temporary Vault, Oak Ridge Cemetery.  Yes   September 19, 1871  Coffin placed in Lincoln Tomb (still under construction then), in temporary crypt in south wall Catacomb. The original walnut outer coffin is replaced by a new iron coffin.  Yes   October 9, 1874  Coffin placed in (white marble) sarcophagus in Catacomb, Lincoln Tomb. It is found that the iron coffin is too large to fit into the sarcophagus, so it is replaced with a new red cedar coffin. Lincoln Tomb was dedicated Oct 15, 1874.     November 7, 1876  Coffin partly lifted from sarcophagus during an attempted theft. The thieves only moved the coffin 18 inches [46 cm] when they were interrupted by police.     November 9, 1876  Coffin replaced in sarcophagus, which was then closed and sealed.     November 13, 1876  Coffin removed (daytime) to place near northwest wall Catacomb, to be transported later that day.     November 13, 1876  Coffin removed (nighttime) to secret location (eastside Lincoln Tomb, inside, near the base of the obelisk).     November 14, 1876  Coffin placed into wooden case at the secret location (eastside Lincoln Tomb, near the inside base of the obelisk).     November 18, 1878  Coffin replaced to another secret location (northside Lincoln Tomb, near the inside base of the obelisk).     November 20, 1878  Lincoln was exhumed and reburied at same secret location (northside Lincoln Tomb) in response to an anonymous threat, received by the caretaker of the tomb via a postcard. The coffin was untouched in the grave in which it was placed a mere two nights before.     April 14, 1887  Coffin removed to Memorial Hall for identification.  Yes   April 14, 1887  Coffin placed in newly built vault beneath floor of the Catacomb, Lincoln Tomb. After the coffins (of Lincoln and his wife) were lowered into the vault, it was filled with cement nearly in a liquid state, which in a short time hardened as a solid mass of stone, more than four feet and a half in depth over the top of the coffins. Over that the tessellated marble floor was relaid, and the sarcophagus placed in the original position.     March 10, 1900  Coffin removed to a temporary vault dug into the hillside behind the monument (i.e. a secret place a few yards northeast of Lincoln's Tomb) during tomb reconstruction, which started in 1899 and lasted 15 months. [18]      April 24, 1901  Coffin removed to reconstructed Lincoln Tomb.     July 10, 1901  Coffin temporarily removed to empty crypt in the south wall of the Catacomb in order to build a permanent crypt under the floor of the Catacomb.     September 26, 1901  Coffin brought to and opened in Memorial Hall, for identification  Yes   September 26, 1901  Coffin permanently placed in a steel cage, and embedded in concrete, 10 feet (3.0 m) deep under the floor of the Catacomb. The sarcophagus in front of the place where Lincoln is finally interred is empty. The original white marble sarcophagus was replaced in 1931 by the present red granite marker. It was not necessary to move Lincoln's body in the 1931 construction, because the cenotaph was placed 6 feet (1.8 m) and thirty inches (76 cm) south from the inside north wall, with foundation as low as that of Lincoln's grave.   Movements of remains of other family members [ edit ] On May 4, 1865, (Lincoln's arrival at Oak Ridge Cemetery, nineteen days after his death) another coffin, containing the body of Lincoln's son Willie (1850–1862) was placed with Lincoln's in the Receiving Vault. Willie had been initially interred in the Carroll family tomb at the Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown. His remains accompanied those of his father on the funeral train to Springfield. On December 21, 1865, the two caskets were moved to the temporary vault, halfway up the hillside, where the Lincoln Tomb was in construction at the top of the hill. The body of Lincoln's son Edward "Eddie" Baker Lincoln (three years, ten months) was already placed there on December 13, 1865. Eddie, born March 10, 1846, died February 1, 1850, and was first buried at the Hutchinson Cemetery in Springfield. The three bodies rested in the temporary vault while the Lincoln tomb was being built. The three bodies were moved to the catacomb of the tomb on September 19, 1871. They were not the first. Two months earlier (on July 17, 1871) it was Lincoln's son Thomas ("Tad") Lincoln, born April 4, 1853, who was the first Lincoln placed into a crypt in the Lincoln Tomb. Tad died on July 15, 1871, in Chicago, Illinois, aged eighteen. Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (December 13, 1818 – July 16, 1882). She was buried July 19, 1882, in one of the family crypts in the Lincoln Tomb. In the night of July 21, 1882, Mary Todd's casket was secretly taken from the crypt and at Robert Todd Lincoln's (her eldest son) request, buried alongside the President. On April 14, 1887, both caskets were moved to Memorial Hall. Lincoln's teenage grandson and namesake, Abraham Lincoln II ("Jack"), born August 14, 1873, died March 5, 1890, in London and was temporarily buried in Kensal Green Cemetery , London, until his father returned to the U.S. with his body and on November 8, 1890, was placed in one of the crypts in the Lincoln Tomb. His body remained in the tomb until May 27, 1930, when he was re-interred at the family plot of his father, Robert Todd Lincoln (August 1, 1843, to July 25, 1926), at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. During the first Lincoln Tomb reconstruction (1900–1901), the Lincoln family was disinterred and moved to the temporary vault northeast of the tomb. On April 24, 1901, the Lincoln family was removed from the temporary vault and placed back into the Lincoln Tomb. While President Lincoln was finally at rest, the remainder of the Lincoln family was moved two more times. The coffins containing the bodies of Mary, Eddie, Willie, and Tad Lincoln were removed during the second tomb reconstruction (1930–1931) from their crypts and transported to the Oak Ridge mausoleum, located near the south gate of the cemetery. After the second reconstruction was completed, the bodies were returned to their crypts in June 1931.

At the time, many people felt a theatre was not a proper place for a president to die.  The White House was only six blocks away—but a bumpy carriage ride on Washington’s unpaved streets might kill Lincoln immediately.  Soldiers carried Lincoln down the stairs of the theatre and out onto Tenth Street.  Standing on the Petersen boarding house stoop across the street, Henry Safford had heard the commotion. He knew that Willie Clark , a fellow boarder, was out for the night—and his room was vacant. He yelled to the soldiers, “Bring him in here!”  In the front parlor, First Lady Mary Lincoln awaited word of her husband, occasionally venturing in to visit him. In the back parlor, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton interrogated witnesses and directed the investigation.  Outside, thousands of people crowded onto Tenth Street and kept vigil through the night.  President Abraham Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865. Mary Lincoln was not in the room with him. Soldiers quickly removed his body to the White House for an autopsy and to prepare for a funeral.  At 11:00 a.m., Vice President Andrew Johnson took the oath of office as the 17th president.

Seward  Frederick Seward  Augustus Seward  Fanny Seward  George F. Robinson  Emerick Hansell  Perpetrators John Wilkes Booth and co-conspirators Motive Revenge for the Confederate States  On April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln , the 16th president of the United States , was assassinated by well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth while attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Shot in the head as he watched the play, [2] Lincoln died the following day at 7:22 am in the Petersen House opposite the theater. [3] He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated. [4] His funeral and burial were marked by an extended period of national mourning. Near the end of the American Civil War , Lincoln's assassination was part of a larger conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the federal government .
Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President  Andrew Johnson .
Beyond Lincoln's death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded, and Johnson's would-be attacker became drunk instead of killing the vice president. After a dramatic initial escape, Booth was killed at the end of a 12-day chase. Powell, Herold, Atzerodt, and Mary Surratt were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.  Background Abandoned plan to kidnap Lincoln The last known high-quality image of Lincoln, taken on the balcony at the White House, March 6, 1865 John Wilkes Booth , c. 1865 The Surratt house Booth was present as Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address a month before the assassination. John Wilkes Booth , born in Maryland into a family of prominent stage actors , had by the time of the assassination become a famous actor and national celebrity in his own right. He was also an outspoken Confederate sympathizer; in late 1860 he was initiated in the pro-Confederate Knights of the Golden Circle in Baltimore , Maryland. [5] : 67  In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant , commander of the Union armies, suspended the exchange of prisoners of war with the Confederate Army [6] to increase pressure on the manpower-starved South. Booth conceived a plan to kidnap Lincoln in order to blackmail the Union into resuming prisoner exchanges, [7] : 130–34 and recruited Samuel Arnold , George Atzerodt , David Herold , Michael O'Laughlen , Lewis Powell (also known as "Lewis Paine"), and John Surratt to help him. Surratt's mother, Mary Surratt , left her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland , and moved to a house in Washington, D.C. , where Booth became a frequent visitor. While Booth and Lincoln were not personally acquainted, Lincoln had seen Booth at Ford's Theatre in 1863. [8] : 419 [9] [10] After the assassination, actor Frank Mordaunt wrote that Lincoln, who apparently harbored no suspicions about Booth, admired the actor and had repeatedly invited him (without success) to visit the White House . [11] : 325–26 Booth attended Lincoln's second inauguration on March 4, 1865, writing in his diary afterwards: "What an excellent chance I had, if I wished, to kill the President on Inauguration day!" [7] : 174, 437n41  On March 17, Booth and the other conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he returned from a play at Campbell General Hospital in northwest Washington. But Lincoln did not go to the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel . [7] : 185 Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the abortive kidnap attempt, might have been able to attack Lincoln at the hotel. [7] : 185–86, 439n17 [12] : 25  Meanwhile, the Confederacy was collapsing. On April 3, Richmond, Virginia , the Confederate capital, fell to the Union Army . On April 9, General  Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia  surrendered to General  Ulysses S. Grant and his Army of the Potomac after the Battle of Appomattox Court House . Confederate President  Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials had fled. Nevertheless, Booth continued to believe in the Confederate cause and sought a way to salvage it. Booth decided to murder Lincoln.

In a letter to his mother, he wrote of his desire to avenge the South. [14]  Doris Kearns Goodwin has endorsed the idea that another factor was Booth's rivalry with his well-known older brother, actor Edwin Booth , who was a loyal Unionist. [15]  David S. Reynolds believes that, despite disagreeing with his cause, Booth greatly admired the abolitionist  John Brown ; [16] Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke quoted him as saying: "John Brown was a man inspired, the grandest character of the century!" [16] [17]  On April 11, Booth attended Lincoln's last speech, in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for emancipated slaves; [18] Booth said,
"That means nigger citizenship.  ... That is the last speech he will ever give." [19] Enraged, Booth urged Powell to shoot Lincoln on the spot. Whether Booth made this request because he was not armed or considered Powell a better shot than himself (Powell, unlike Booth, had served in the Confederate Army and thus had military experience) is unknown. In any event, Powell refused for fear of the crowd, and Booth was either unable or unwilling to personally attempt to kill the president. However, Booth said to David Herold, "By God, I'll put him through." [20] [8] : 91  Lincoln's premonitions According to Ward Hill Lamon , three days before his death, Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds: I kept on until I arrived at the East Room , which I entered. There I met with a sickening surprise. Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments. Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards; and there was a throng of people, gazing mournfully upon the corpse, whose face was covered, others weeping pitifully. "Who is dead in the White House?" I demanded of one of the soldiers, "The President," was his answer; "he was killed by an assassin." [21] However, Lincoln went on to tell Lamon that "In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else." [22] [23] Paranormal investigator Joe Nickell writes that dreams of assassination would not be unexpected in the first place, considering the Baltimore Plot and an additional assassination attempt in which a hole was shot through Lincoln's hat. [22]  For months Lincoln had looked pale and haggard, but on the morning of the assassination he told people how happy he was. First Lady  Mary Lincoln felt such talk could bring bad luck. [24] : 346 Lincoln told his cabinet that he had dreamed of being on a "singular and indescribable vessel that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore", and that he had had the same dream before "nearly every great and important event of the War" such as the Union victories at Antietam , Murfreesboro , Gettysburg and Vicksburg . [25]  Preparations Advertisement for Our American Cousin (Washington Evening Star , April 14, 1865) On April 14, Booth's morning started at midnight. He wrote his mother that all was well but that he was "in haste". In his diary, he wrote that "Our cause being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done". [13] : 728 [24] : 346  While visiting Ford's Theatre around noon to pick up his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to visit the theater that evening for a performance of Our American Cousin . This provided him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was familiar to its staff. [12] : 12 [8] : 108–09 Booth went to Mary Surratt's boarding house in Washington, D.C., and asked her to deliver a package to her tavern in Surrattsville, Maryland. He also asked her to tell her tenant Louis J. Weichmann to ready the guns and ammunition that Booth had previously stored at the tavern. [12] : 19  Ford's Theatre The conspirators met for the final time at 8:45  pm. Booth assigned Powell to kill Secretary of State  William H. Seward at his home, Atzerodt to kill Vice President  Andrew Johnson at the Kirkwood Hotel, and Herold to guide Powell (who was unfamiliar with Washington) to the Seward house and then to a rendezvous with Booth in Maryland. Booth was the only well-known member of the conspiracy. Access to the theater's upper floor containing the Presidential Box was restricted, and Booth was the only plotter who could have realistically expected to be admitted there without difficulty. Furthermore, it would have been reasonable (but ultimately incorrect) for the plotters to have assumed that the entrance of the box would itself be guarded. Had it been, Booth would have been the only plotter with a plausible chance of gaining access to the President, or at least to gain entry to the box without being searched for weapons first. Booth planned to shoot Lincoln at point-blank range with his single-shot Philadelphia Deringer  pistol and then stab Grant at the theater. They were all to strike simultaneously shortly after ten o'clock. [8] : 112 Atzerodt tried to withdraw from the plot, which to this point had involved only kidnapping, not murder, but Booth pressured him to continue. [7] : 212  Assassination of Lincoln Lincoln's box Lincoln arrives at the theater Despite what Booth had heard earlier in the day, Grant and his wife, Julia Grant , had declined to accompany the Lincolns, as Mary Lincoln and Julia Grant were not on good terms. [26] : 45 [b] Others in succession also declined the Lincolns' invitation, until finally Major  Henry Rathbone and his fiancée Clara Harris (daughter of U.S. Senator  Ira Harris of New York ) accepted. [12] : 32 At one point, Mary developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. [28] Lincoln's footman , William H. Crook , advised him not to go, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife. [29] Lincoln told Speaker of the House  Schuyler Colfax , "I suppose it's time to go though I would rather stay" before assisting Mary into the carriage. The presidential party arrived late and settled into their box (two adjoining boxes with a dividing partition removed). The play was interrupted, and the orchestra played " Hail to the Chief " as the full house of some 1,700 rose in applause. [30] Lincoln sat in a rocking chair that had been selected for him from among the Ford family's personal furnishings. [31] [32]  Booth's Philadelphia Deringer The cast modified a line of the play in honor of Lincoln: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the reply – scripted as, "Well, you're not the only one that wants to escape the draft " – was delivered instead as, "The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!" [33] A member of the audience observed that Mary Lincoln often called her husband's attention to aspects of the action onstage, and "seemed to take great pleasure in witnessing his enjoyment." [34]  At one point, Mary whispered to Lincoln, who was holding her hand, "What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?" Lincoln replied, "She won't think anything about it". [12] : 39 In following years, these words were traditionally considered Lincoln's last, though N.W. Miner, a family friend, claimed in 1882 that Mary Lincoln told him that Lincoln's last words expressed a wish to visit Jerusalem . [35]  Booth shoots Lincoln This Currier & Ives print (1865) implies Rathbone was already rising as Booth fired; in fact, Rathbone was unaware of Booth until he heard the shot. With Crook off duty and Ward Hill Lamon away, policeman John Frederick Parker was assigned to guard the Presidential Box. [36] At intermission he went to a nearby tavern along with Lincoln's valet, Charles Forbes, and Coachman Francis Burke. It was also the same tavern Booth was waiting by having several drinks to prepare his time. It is unclear whether Parker returned to the theater, but he was certainly not at his post when Booth entered the box. [37] In any event, there is no certainty that entry would have been denied to a celebrity such as Booth. Booth had prepared a brace to bar the door after entering the box, indicating that he expected a guard. After spending time at the tavern, Booth entered Ford's Theatre one last time at about 10:10 pm, this time through the theater's front entrance. He passed through the dress circle and went to the door that led to the Presidential Box after showing Charles Forbes his calling card. Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd saw Booth arrive: [38]  About 10:25 pm, a man came in and walked slowly along the side on which the "Pres" box was and I heard a man say, "There's Booth" and I turned my head to look at him. He was still walking very slow and was near the box door when he stopped, took a card from his pocket, wrote something on it, and gave it to the usher who took it to the box. In a minute the door was opened and he walked in. Once inside the hallway, Booth barricaded the door by wedging a stick between it and the wall. From here, a second door led to Lincoln's box. There is evidence that, earlier in the day, Booth had bored a peephole in this second door. [39] [40] : 173  Washington Metropolitan Police De­part­ment blotter for April 14 (lower quarter of page): "At this hour the mel­an­choly intel­li­gence of the assas­si­na­tion of Mr. Lincoln  ... was brought to this office  ... the assassin is a man named J. Wilks [ sic ] Booth." Booth knew the play Our American Cousin by heart and waited to time his shot at about 10:15 pm, with the laughter at one of the hilarious lines of the play, delivered by actor Harry Hawk : "Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal; you sockdologizing old man-trap!". Lincoln was laughing at this line [41] : 96 when Booth opened the door, stepped forward, and shot Lincoln from behind with his pistol. [2]  The bullet entered Lincoln's skull behind his left ear, passed through his brain, and came to rest near the front of the skull after fracturing both orbital plates . [c] [44] Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. [46] [47] Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like "Freedom!" [48]  Booth escapes Booth's dagger Rathbone jumped from his seat and struggled with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife with which he stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as he prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; [49] Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box , and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought he was part of the play. Booth held his bloody knife over his head and yelled something to the audience. While it is traditionally held that Booth shouted the Virginia state motto, Sic semper tyrannis ! ("Thus always to tyrants") either from the box or the stage, witness accounts conflict. [13] : 739 Most recalled hearing Sic semper tyrannis! but others – including Booth himself – said he yelled only Sic semper! [50] [51] (Some did not recall Booth saying anything in Latin.) There is similar uncertainty about what Booth shouted next, in English: either "The South is avenged!", [12] : 48 "Revenge for the South!", or "The South shall be free!" (Two witnesses remembered Booth's words as: "I have done it!") Immediately after Booth landed on the stage, Major Joseph B. Stewart climbed over the orchestra pit and footlights and pursued Booth across the stage. [49] The screams of Mary Lincoln and Clara Harris, and Rathbone's cries of, "Stop that man!" [12] : 49 prompted others to join the chase as pandemonium broke out. Booth exited the theater through a side door, en route stabbing orchestra leader William Withers, Jr. [52] [53] As he leapt into the saddle of his getaway horse Booth pushed away Joseph Burroughs, [a] who had been holding the horse, striking Burroughs with the handle of his knife. [54] [55] [56] [1]  Death of Lincoln Surgeon Charles Leale Charles Leale , a young Union Army surgeon, pushed through the crowd to the door of the Presidential Box, but could not open it until Rathbone, inside, noticed and removed the wooden brace with which Booth had jammed the door shut. [8] : 120  Leale found Lincoln seated with his head leaning to his right [43] as Mary held him and sobbed: "His eyes were closed and he was in a profoundly comatose condition, while his breathing was intermittent and exceedingly stertorous ." [57] [58] Thinking Lincoln had been stabbed, Leale shifted him to the floor. Meanwhile, another physician, Charles Sabin Taft , was lifted into the box from the stage. After Leale and bystander William Kent cut away Lincoln's collar while unbuttoning his coat and shirt and found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed but dislodged a blood clot , after which Lincoln's breathing improved; [8] : 121–22 he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. After giving Lincoln artificial respiration , Leale allowed actress Laura Keene to cradle the President's head in her lap. He pronounced the wound mortal. [12] : 78  Skull fragments and probe used. Leale, Taft, and another doctor, Albert King , decided that Lincoln must be moved to the nearest house on Tenth Street because a carriage ride to the White House was too dangerous. Carefully, seven men picked up Lincoln and slowly carried him out of the theater, where it was packed with an angry mob. After considering Peter Taltavull 's Star Saloon next door, they concluded that they would take Lincoln to one of the houses across the way. It was raining as soldiers carried Lincoln into the street, [59] where a man urged them toward the house of tailor William Petersen . [60] In Petersen's first-floor bedroom, the exceptionally tall Lincoln was laid diagonally on a small bed. [8] : 123–24  Lincoln's deathbed [d] After clearing everyone out of the room, including Mrs. Lincoln, the doctors cut away Lincoln's clothes but discovered no other wounds; finding that Lincoln was cold, they applied hot water bottles and mustard plasters while covering his cold body with blankets. Later, more physicians arrived: Surgeon General  Joseph K. Barnes , Charles Henry Crane , Anderson Ruffin Abbott , and Robert K. Stone (Lincoln's personal physician). All agreed Lincoln could not survive. Barnes probed the wound, locating the bullet and some bone fragments. Throughout the night, as the hemorrhage continued, they removed blood clots to relieve pressure on the brain, [62] and Leale held the comatose president's hand with a firm grip, "to let him know that he was in touch with humanity and had a friend." [8] : 14 [63]  The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln ( Alonzo Chappel , 1868) [e] Lincoln's older son Robert Todd Lincoln arrived at about 11 pm, but twelve-year-old Tad Lincoln , who was watching a play of Aladdin at Grover's Theater when he learned of his father's assassination, was kept away. Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles and Secretary of War  Edwin M. Stanton arrived. Stanton insisted that the sobbing Mrs. Lincoln leave the sick room, then for the rest of the night he essentially ran the United States government from the house, including directing the hunt for Booth and the other conspirators. [8] : 127–28 Guards kept the public away, but numerous officials and physicians were admitted to pay their respects. [62]  "The following notes, taken by Dr. Abbott , show the condition of the President throughout the night" ( Evening Star , Washington D.C., April 15, 1865); [64] Abbott was a black doctor from Toronto who had served in the Union Army [65] Initially, Lincoln's features were calm and his breathing slow and steady. Later, one of his eyes became swollen and the right side of his face discolored. [66]  Maunsell Bradhurst Field wrote in a letter to The New York Times that Lincoln then started "breathing regularly, but with effort, and did not seem to be struggling or suffering." [67] [68] As he neared death, Lincoln's appearance became "perfectly natural" [67] (except for the discoloration around his eyes). [69] Shortly before 7  am Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, [70] and, as Dixon reported, "she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name." [71]  Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. [3] Mary Lincoln was not present. [72] [73] In his last moments, Lincoln's face became calm and his breathing quieter. [74] Field wrote there was "no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat ... [only] a mere cessation of breathing". [67] [68] According to Lincoln's secretary John Hay , at the moment of Lincoln's death, "a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features". [75] The assembly knelt for a prayer, after which Stanton said either, "Now he belongs to the ages" or, "Now he belongs to the angels." [8] : 134 [76]  On Lincoln's death, Vice President Johnson became the 17th president of the United States. The presidential oath of office was administered to Johnson by Chief Justice  Salmon Chase sometime between 10 and 11  am. [77]  Powell attacks Seward An artist's depiction of Lewis Powell attacking William Seward 's son, Frederick W. Seward Booth had assigned Lewis Powell to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward. On the night of the assassination, Seward was at his home on Lafayette Square , confined to bed and recovering from injuries sustained on April 5 from being thrown from his carriage. Herold guided Powell to Seward's house. Powell carried an 1858 Whitney revolver (a large, heavy, and popular gun during the Civil War) and a Bowie knife . William Bell , Seward's maître d' , answered the door when Powell knocked 10:10  pm, as Booth made his way to the Presidential Box at Ford's Theater. Powell told Bell that he had medicine from Seward's physician and that his instructions were to personally show Seward how to take it. Overcoming Bell's skepticism, Powell made his way up the stairs to Seward's third-floor bedroom. [12] : 54 [13] : 736 [78] At the top of the staircase he was stopped by Seward's son, Assistant Secretary of State  Frederick W. Seward , to whom he repeated the medicine story; Frederick, suspicious, said his father was asleep. William and Fanny Seward in 1861 Hearing voices, Seward's daughter Fanny emerged from Seward's room and said, "Fred, Father is awake now" – thus revealing to Powell where Seward was. Powell turned as if to start downstairs but suddenly turned again and drew his revolver. He aimed at Frederick's forehead and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired, so he bludgeoned Frederick unconscious with it. Bell, yelling "Murder! Murder!", ran outside for help. Fanny opened the door again, and Powell shoved past her to Seward's bed. He stabbed at Seward's face and neck, slicing open his cheek. [12] : 58 However, the splint (often mistakenly described as a neck brace ) that doctors had fitted to Seward's broken jaw prevented the blade from penetrating his jugular vein. [13] : 737 Seward eventually recovered, though with serious scars on his face. Seward's son Augustus and Sergeant George F. Robinson , a soldier assigned to Seward, were alerted by Fanny's screams and received stab wounds in struggling with Powell. As Augustus went for a pistol, Powell ran downstairs toward the door, [79] : 275 where he encountered Emerick Hansell, a State Department messenger. [80] [81] Powell stabbed Hansell in the back, then ran outside exclaiming, "I'm mad! I'm mad!" Screams from the house had frightened Herold, who ran off, leaving Powell to find his own way in an unfamiliar city. [12] : 59  Atzerodt fails to attack Johnson Booth had assigned George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson, who was staying at the Kirkwood House in Washington. Atzerodt was to go to Johnson's room at 10:15 pm and shoot him. [13] : 735 On April 14, Atzerodt rented the room directly above Johnson's; the next day, he arrived there at the appointed time and, carrying a gun and knife, went to the bar downstairs, where he asked the bartender about Johnson's character and behavior. He eventually became drunk and wandered off through the streets, tossing his knife away at some point. He made his way to the Pennsylvania House Hotel by 2 am, where he obtained a room and went to sleep. [8] : 166–67 [79] : 335  Earlier in the day, Booth had stopped by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: "I don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth." [78] One theory holds that Booth was trying to find out whether Johnson was expected at the Kirkwood that night; [8] : 111 another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy.

[83] Numerous foreign governments issued proclamations and declared periods of mourning on April 15. [84] [85] Lincoln was praised in sermons on Easter Sunday , which fell on the day after his death. [79] : 357  On April 18, mourners lined up seven abreast for a mile to view Lincoln in his walnut casket in the White House's black-draped East Room . Special trains brought thousands from other cities, some of whom slept on the Capitol 's lawn. [86] : 120–23 Hundreds of thousands watched the funeral procession on April 19, [12] : 213 and millions more lined the 1,700-mile (2,700 km) route of the train which took Lincoln's remains through New York to Springfield , Illinois , often passing trackside tributes in the form of bands, bonfires, and hymn-singing.

(Unknown artist) Poet Walt Whitman composed " When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd ", " O Captain! My Captain! ", and two other poems, to eulogize Lincoln. [88] [89]  Ulysses S. Grant called Lincoln "incontestably the greatest man I ever knew." [13] : 747 Robert E. Lee expressed sadness. [90] Southern-born Elizabeth Blair said that "Those of Southern born sympathies know now they have lost a friend willing and more powerful to protect and serve them than they can now ever hope to find again." [13] : 744 African-American orator Frederick Douglass called the assassination an "unspeakable calamity". [90]  British Foreign Secretary  Lord Russell called Lincoln's death a "sad calamity." [85]  China 's chief secretary of state for foreign affairs, Prince Kung , described himself as "inexpressibly shocked and startled". [84]  Ecuadorian president Gabriel García Moreno said, "Never should I have thought that the noble country of Washington would be humiliated by such a black and horrible crime; nor should I ever have thought that Mr. Lincoln would come to such a horrible end, after having served his country with such wisdom and glory under so critical circumstances." [84] [85] The government of Liberia issued a proclamation calling Lincoln "not only the ruler of his own people, but a father to millions of a race stricken and oppressed." [85] The government of Haiti condemned the assassination as a "horrid crime". [85]  Flight and capture of the conspirators Booth's escape route Booth and Herold Within half an hour of fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth crossed the Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland. [12] : 67–68 A Union Army sentry named Silas Cobb questioned him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he was going home to the nearby town of Charles. Although it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 pm, the sentry let him through. [91] Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later [12] : 81–82 and rendezvoused with Booth. [12] : 87 After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville, Herold and Booth rode to the home of Samuel A. Mudd , a local doctor, who splinted the leg [12] : 131, 153 Booth had broken in his escape and later made a pair of crutches for Booth. [12] : 131, 153  After a day at Mudd's house, Booth and Herold hired a local man to guide them to Samuel Cox's house . [12] : 163 Cox, in turn, took them to Thomas Jones, a Confederate sympathizer who hid Booth and Herold in Zekiah Swamp for five days until they could cross the Potomac River . [12] : 224 On the afternoon of April 24, they arrived at the farm of Richard H. Garrett, a tobacco farmer, in King George County, Virginia . Booth told Garrett he was a wounded Confederate soldier. Reward broadside with photographs of John H. Surratt , John Wilkes Booth , and David E. Herold An April 15 letter to Navy Surgeon George Brainerd Todd from his brother tells of the rumors in Washington about Booth: Today all the city is in mourning nearly every house being in black and I have not seen a smile, no business, and many a strong man I have seen in tears – Some reports say Booth is a prisoner, others that he has made his escape – but from orders received here, I believe he is taken, and during the night will be put on a Monitor for safe keeping – as a mob once raised now would know no end. [38]  The hunt for the conspirators quickly became the largest in U.S. history, involving thousands of federal troops and countless civilians. Edwin M. Stanton personally directed the operation, [92] authorizing rewards of $50,000 (equivalent to $1,000,000 in 2022) for Booth and $25,000 each for Herold and John Surratt. [93]  Booth and Herold were sleeping at Garrett's farm on April 26 when soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry arrived and surrounded the barn, then threatened to set fire to it. Herold surrendered, but Booth cried out, "I will not be taken alive!" [12] : 326 The soldiers set fire to the barn [12] : 331 and Booth scrambled for the back door with a rifle and pistol. Sergeant Boston Corbett crept up behind the barn and shot Booth in "the back of the head about an inch below the spot where his [Booth's] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln", [94] severing his spinal cord. [12] : 335 Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, "Tell my mother I die for my country." Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: "Useless ... useless." He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. [12] : 336–40 [78] Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders from Stanton that Booth be taken alive if possible, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public. [41] : 228  Others The Garrett farmhouse, where Booth died April 26 Without Herold to guide him, Powell did not find his way back to the Surratt house until April 17. He told detectives waiting there that he was a ditch-digger hired by Mary Surratt, but she denied knowing him. Both were arrested. [8] : 174–79 George Atzerodt hid at his cousin's farm in Germantown, Maryland , about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Washington, where he was arrested April 20. [8] : 169  The remaining conspirators were arrested by month's end – except for John Surratt , who fled to Quebec where Roman Catholic priests hid him. In September, he boarded a ship to Liverpool, England , staying in the Catholic Church of the Holy Cross there. From there, he moved furtively through Europe until joining the Pontifical Zouaves in the Papal States . A friend from his school days recognized him there in early 1866 and alerted the U.S. government. Surratt was arrested by the Papal authorities but managed to escape under suspicious circumstances. He was finally captured by an agent of the United States in Egypt in November 1866. [95] Conspirators' trial and execution Portraits of the conspirators (excepting Mudd) from Benn Pitman 's The assassination of President Lincoln and the trial of the conspirators Scores of persons were arrested, including many tangential associates of the conspirators and anyone having had even the slightest contact with Booth or Herold during their flight. These included Louis J. Weichmann , a boarder in Mrs. Surratt's house; Booth's brother Junius (in Cincinnati at the time of the assassination); theater owner John T. Ford ; James Pumphrey , from whom Booth hired his horse; John M. Lloyd , the innkeeper who rented Mrs. Surratt's Maryland tavern and gave Booth and Herold weapons and supplies the night of April 14; and Samuel Cox and Thomas A. Jones, who helped Booth and Herold cross the Potomac. [86] : 186–88 All were eventually released except: [86] : 188   Samuel Arnold  George Atzerodt  David Herold  Samuel Mudd  Michael O'Laughlen  Lewis Powell  Edmund Spangler (a theater stagehand who had given Booth's horse to Burroughs to hold)  Mary Surratt The accused were tried by a military tribunal ordered by Johnson, who had succeeded to the presidency on Lincoln's death:  Maj. Gen.  David Hunter (presiding)  Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace  Brig. Gen.  Robert Sanford Foster  Brev. Maj. Gen. Thomas Maley Harris  Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe  Brig. Gen. August Kautz  Col.  James A. Ekin  Col. Charles H. Tompkins  Lt. Col.  David Ramsay Clendenin Trial of the conspirators, June 5, 1865 The prosecution was led by U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt , assisted by Congressman  John A. Bingham and Major  Henry Lawrence Burnett . [96]  The use of a military tribunal provoked criticism from former Attorney General  Edward Bates and Secretary of the Navy  Gideon Welles , who believed that a civil court should have presided, but Attorney General James Speed pointed to the military nature of the conspiracy and the facts that the defendants acted as enemy combatants and that martial law was in force at the time in the District of Columbia . (In 1866, in Ex parte Milligan , the United States Supreme Court banned the use of military tribunals in places where civil courts were operational.) [8] : 213–14 Only a simple majority of the jury was required for a guilty verdict and a two-thirds for a death sentence. There was no route for appeal other than to President Johnson. [8] : 222–23  Execution of Mary Surratt , Lewis Powell , David Herold , and George Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. The seven-week trial included the testimony of 366 witnesses. All of the defendants were found guilty on June 30. Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt were sentenced to death by hanging ; Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlen were sentenced to life in prison. [97] Edmund Spangler was sentenced to six years. After sentencing Mary Surratt to hang, five jurors signed a letter recommending clemency, but Johnson refused to stop the execution; he later claimed he never saw the letter. [8] : 227  Mary Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt were hanged in the Old Arsenal Penitentiary on July 7. [12] : 362, 365 Mary Surratt was the first woman executed by the United States government. [98] O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Mudd, Arnold, and Spangler were pardoned in February 1869 by Johnson. [12] : 367 Spangler, who died in 1875, always insisted his sole connection to the plot was that Booth asked him to hold his horse. [ citation needed ]  John Surratt stood trial in Washington in 1867. Four residents of Elmira, New York , [12] : 27 [99] : 125, 132, 136–37 [100] : 112–15 claimed they had seen him there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) on the day of the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict, and John Surratt was released.

[1]   ^  There is evidence to suggest that either Booth or fellow conspirator Michael O'Laughlen – who resembled Booth – followed the Grants to Union Station late that afternoon and discovered that they would not be at the theater. The Grants later received an anonymous letter from someone who claimed to have boarded their train intending to attack them but was thwarted because the Grants' private car was locked and guarded. [27]   ^  Though the steel ball Booth used as a bullet was of a .41 caliber , the deringer type was a small, easily concealable gun known to be inaccurate and usually just used in close quarters. [42] The bullet most probably passed mainly through the left side of the brain, causing massive damage including the skull fractures, hemorrhaging , and secondary severe edema of the brain. While Dr. Leale's notes mention Lincoln's bulging right eye, [43] the autopsy only specifically states the damage to the left side of the brain.
